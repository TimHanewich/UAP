# https://www.youtube.com/watch/XIgxuiVkzrk

00:00:05.600 Hello and welcome to Reality Check. I'm
00:00:08.240 your host, Ross Coltart, and today I
00:00:10.960 want to introduce you to Jeremiah
00:00:13.200 Horseman and Alexandra Cordwell. If
00:00:16.960 there is an Indiana Jones figure in the
00:00:20.560 whole saga of the mystery objects over
00:00:23.519 the Arizona desert, then Jeremiah fits
00:00:26.880 the bill. As a teenage boy in rural
00:00:31.000 Pennsylvania, Jeremiah witnessed what he
00:00:33.600 describes as two Bigfoot crypted
00:00:36.399 creatures. And that triggered his
00:00:38.480 fascination with the paranormal. He
00:00:41.440 moved to Sedona, Arizona with his
00:00:44.239 equally adventurous partner,
00:00:46.079 photographer Alexandra Caldwell, and
00:00:48.719 became fascinated with the Bradshaw
00:00:51.440 Ranch, a reported hot spot for weird
00:00:54.399 paranormal sightings and rumored portals
00:00:57.520 through which alleged interdimensional
00:01:00.239 entities enter this realm. It's easy to
00:01:04.400 be skeptical of such claims, but it's
00:01:06.640 harder to reject the indisputable video
00:01:10.080 evidence and witness sightings of
00:01:12.400 anomalous craft and orbs that have been
00:01:15.200 seen by many witnesses all over the town
00:01:18.640 of Sedona. It's a hot spot. And Jeremiah
00:01:22.400 and Alexandra have been researching
00:01:25.040 allegations of a deep underground US
00:01:28.400 military base near the town for years.
00:01:31.759 They're convinced it's there and they
00:01:34.400 say they have a very good idea where it
00:01:37.759 is. Here's Jeremiah Horseman and
00:01:41.119 Alexandra Caldwell.
00:02:19.360 Aha. Jeremiah Ross, how are you? Good to
00:02:22.480 see you at long last. Very good to see
00:02:24.239 you. What a great place Sedona is. Oh,
00:02:26.480 thank you. Thank you. Welcome to Sedona.
00:02:28.239 Nice to meet you, Alex. Lovely to meet
00:02:30.160 you. Lovely to meet you. I'm stunned by
00:02:32.800 how beautiful Sedona is. It's gorgeous.
00:02:34.560 It's gorgeous. And you're here on a
00:02:35.599 gorgeous day. And yet, it's a place with
00:02:37.760 a lot of mystery. A lot of mystery. And
00:02:39.360 we're going to show you some of that
00:02:40.239 mystery. Fantastic. Let's right this
00:02:41.680 way.
00:02:49.680 Jeremiah, what's your background? How
00:02:51.360 well do you know this Sedona area? And
00:02:54.160 why do you know anything about the
00:02:56.400 phenomena? It came about by chance about
00:02:58.879 12 years ago now almost 12 years ago
00:03:00.879 that is up this August 12 years ago that
00:03:03.040 we read a book by an author named Tom
00:03:04.879 Dongo about a place called Bradshaw
00:03:06.480 Ranch not far from here and uh we
00:03:08.800 started investigating on our own and
00:03:10.319 encountering a lot of really bizarre
00:03:12.000 phenomena. So you've seen anomalous
00:03:14.640 phenomena yourself? We have. Yes. Over
00:03:16.400 the past 12 years quite a bit like what?
00:03:18.959 Um balls of light in the air. Uh we've
00:03:21.599 seen um full structured craft. that
00:03:24.879 we've seen. So when you say craft,
00:03:27.040 you're not just talking about aircraft.
00:03:28.560 No. What are you talking about? UFOs or
00:03:31.200 UAPs are now being called unidentified.
00:03:33.680 Unidentified. So you think it's all
00:03:35.599 real? Absolutely. Absolutely. Seeing is
00:03:38.239 believing. And we saw the our first
00:03:40.159 structured craft sighting was near
00:03:41.440 Flagstaff. And that was it was so close
00:03:43.680 we could throw a tennis ball at it. And
00:03:45.440 what did you see? We saw a craft coming
00:03:48.000 uh out of Flagstaff, which we thought at
00:03:49.840 first was an aircraft coming into land.
00:03:51.840 It was a light in the distance and it
00:03:53.280 was moving in a in a very low trajectory
00:03:55.599 over the road and I remember turning to
00:03:57.439 her at night. It was about 9 at night a
00:03:59.280 little bit after and I said, "That's a
00:04:00.879 strange direction for a a plane to be
00:04:02.560 coming into Poleium to land." And we
00:04:04.159 just dismissed it from there. We went
00:04:05.920 down through a grassy swale and as we
00:04:07.920 came up the hill on the other side, we
00:04:09.280 passed a a road sign that said uh
00:04:11.120 Griffith Springs Park and it's just
00:04:12.799 forest beyond that. As we came up the
00:04:14.640 hill, immediately on our left above the
00:04:16.238 trees was this very large craft. And
00:04:18.320 you're going to laugh at me, but it was
00:04:19.440 peanut shaped. It was it was narrow in
00:04:21.918 the center and bulbous on both sides,
00:04:23.800 metallic. And in the center was a a
00:04:26.479 window that was rectangular with a
00:04:28.000 yellow light on the inside and then
00:04:29.360 there were multicolored lights on the
00:04:30.880 outside. It was huge. It was as big as
00:04:32.880 our house. You're kidding. No. And that
00:04:35.040 was that made a true believer out of
00:04:36.639 both of us. We were at that point.
00:04:39.199 You've seen this as well, Alexander.
00:04:41.040 You're not he's not gone bonkers on you
00:04:42.560 in some No, I witnessed the whole thing
00:04:44.960 and it was close enough I could have
00:04:46.560 thrown a tennis ball and hit it right
00:04:48.800 next to the road. So, what is it? That's
00:04:51.680 the big question. You got any theories,
00:04:54.320 Jeremiah? It wasn't ours. That I'm quite
00:04:57.440 certain. And the reason I say that,
00:04:58.800 Ross, is we still use thrust in
00:05:01.040 propulsion. And the little bit of time
00:05:02.800 that we saw it before I panicked, uh, we
00:05:05.040 were looking at it right over the
00:05:05.919 treetops and there was no thrust. The
00:05:07.600 trees were perfectly still. The not no
00:05:10.080 branches were moving. As you know, there
00:05:11.840 are anomalous phenomena being seen all
00:05:14.320 over Arizona and it's getting to the
00:05:16.240 point where it's undeniable. The
00:05:18.240 military is seeing it. Pilots are
00:05:19.919 reporting it. There are videos of
00:05:21.919 anomalous objects doing weird things.
00:05:25.120 And we're trying to figure out if what
00:05:27.600 David Grush told me on NewsNation in
00:05:30.160 2023 is true. Why on earth would a dark
00:05:33.919 black military project be located right
00:05:36.479 next to one of the biggest tourist
00:05:38.000 attractions in Arizona? Well, I spoke to
00:05:40.080 a man named Andy Bamante about that,
00:05:42.479 former CIA man, and I asked him more or
00:05:44.400 less the same question, and he shook his
00:05:46.479 head. He said, "Jeremiah," he said,
00:05:47.680 "that's the way we do things. We hide
00:05:49.280 things in plain sight." He said, "Right
00:05:50.720 under the the the noses of the public,
00:05:53.120 and they did that here." So, what
00:05:54.720 evidence have you got that there is any
00:05:56.400 kind of military presence here? Because
00:05:58.240 there's no military base declared
00:06:00.720 anywhere around Sedona. I think the
00:06:02.479 closest one is Phoenix, which is 2 hours
00:06:05.039 away. To cut right to the chase, we had
00:06:07.440 several nasty encounters. And mind you,
00:06:09.280 again, our our main goal was looking at
00:06:11.280 uh Anastasia dwellings in the cliffs and
00:06:13.360 pictographs, but to do so, we had to
00:06:15.199 cross some fences that were in some
00:06:16.479 strange places. Uh in doing that, we had
00:06:19.120 several nasty encounters with people who
00:06:21.440 looked military, but I suspect were
00:06:23.199 military contractors, say for one, who
00:06:25.199 actually had a DoD lanyard. So, if
00:06:27.440 there's a a man here with the Department
00:06:28.960 of Defense in the middle of nowhere,
00:06:31.120 close to Secret Mountain, as he was,
00:06:33.039 then somebody's here doing something for
00:06:34.880 some reason. And I suspect it's because
00:06:36.560 those areas are the areas where they're
00:06:38.880 either base entrances or they're cutting
00:06:41.520 security for their test when they put
00:06:43.520 their craft in the air. So these men
00:06:44.960 that stopped you, were they armed? The
00:06:47.120 the there were several that were armed
00:06:48.960 and the one the man with the DoD was not
00:06:50.720 armed. And the men that stopped you and
00:06:53.120 threatened you and told you to leave,
00:06:55.919 were they wearing any kind of incinior
00:06:58.479 or name badge or rank ID? None. None at
00:07:02.400 all. No. Are you aware of something
00:07:04.080 called posy commatati? No. Which is
00:07:06.720 essentially it's a a law that was passed
00:07:08.639 by your congress. It's a constitutional
00:07:10.880 finding that the army is not allowed to
00:07:13.360 be used. Your military is not allowed to
00:07:15.360 be used against the public against the
00:07:17.520 citizenry and it's a protection against
00:07:19.599 the anarchy that took place under the
00:07:21.280 British.
00:07:22.680 So if the military is operating in this
00:07:26.680 area without any kind of
00:07:29.800 formal legal authority, it's doing it
00:07:32.880 illegally. They are. They are. And
00:07:34.400 they're doing it with quite brute force
00:07:35.840 as well in curse words. So you you've
00:07:38.880 been threatened. We've not only been
00:07:40.400 threatened, but we were shot at. Shot
00:07:42.240 at? We were shot at. In what context? Uh
00:07:45.759 we we found a a pictograph panel and a
00:07:47.919 dwelling that we wanted to see in the
00:07:48.960 rear of Boon Canyon, a rather remote
00:07:50.639 place. and innocently climbing to it
00:07:52.880 about a 600 foot climb. Uh and we saw
00:07:56.080 the site, photographed it. We were
00:07:58.000 coming back down and she was slightly
00:07:59.280 ahead of me and we heard voices to the
00:08:01.440 north of us in a very remote area. Mind
00:08:03.199 you, no trails in this area. It's very
00:08:04.639 thick. And those voices were perce were
00:08:07.360 were talking for probably about what 10
00:08:09.680 seconds and we both stopped to listen
00:08:11.440 because we were sure there was nobody
00:08:12.479 ahead of us. And then we heard what I
00:08:14.400 could best describe as the sound of a
00:08:15.840 bunker door closing. A metallic boom, a
00:08:18.080 hollow metallic boom echoed throughout
00:08:19.680 the canyon in that area.
00:08:21.360 I stopped. I paused and I looked down at
00:08:23.199 her. She was maybe 10 or 15 feet below
00:08:24.960 me and I said, "Did you hear that?" And
00:08:26.160 she said, "Yeah." And I said, "What did
00:08:27.919 you think that was?" She said, "I don't
00:08:29.120 know." And she no sooner finished that
00:08:31.199 phrase, and we heard voices again. So,
00:08:33.200 we both paused. And again, the same
00:08:34.958 sound repeated, a a metallic boom that
00:08:36.958 was rather hollow. Gosh, you know what
00:08:38.399 that suggests? Yes. It suggests there
00:08:40.640 some kind of secret door. Absolutely.
00:08:43.039 That's the first thing we talk about. It
00:08:44.240 sounds crazy. I mean I I I I guess I
00:08:46.399 have difficulty accepting accepting that
00:08:49.120 there's any basis upon which they would
00:08:51.519 locate such a secret facility so close
00:08:53.440 to a tourist town. We did too until the
00:08:56.160 bullet started flying. Just talk me
00:08:57.760 through it, Jeremiah. Where exactly were
00:08:59.279 you sitting? Sure. Um so you can see the
00:09:01.120 very first peninsula, if you will, of
00:09:02.640 Red Rock coming out. So the the closest
00:09:04.959 rock, the closest one. There's a little
00:09:06.320 bit of abutment sticking out by itself.
00:09:08.000 Y and we had climbed up the top of that
00:09:09.760 just in the odd chance we might see some
00:09:11.279 pictographs or
00:09:19.399 petetrogns coming in were our own. As we
00:09:22.080 were up there, we saw a long white
00:09:24.080 pickup truck with a long radio antenna
00:09:25.760 on the top pull in in the drive here
00:09:27.360 behind us. Our car was parked down the
00:09:29.360 road of the waves. Uh a man dressed in
00:09:32.160 somewhat of a forest service uniform was
00:09:34.560 walking rapidly down the way. He had a
00:09:36.560 phone in one hand and you clearly see
00:09:38.640 from the outline of his shirt uh that he
00:09:40.880 was wearing body armor and the there was
00:09:43.279 he also had a handgun tucked under the
00:09:45.440 front of his shirt like so. So just
00:09:47.279 before we go any further, what is that
00:09:49.360 area behind the fence there meant to be?
00:09:52.480 There's a there's two things over there.
00:09:54.160 There's a empty canyon and I say empty
00:09:56.160 with uh tongue and cheek called Red
00:09:58.240 Canyon and right beside that is a public
00:10:00.000 site called Palaki and it's called the
00:10:01.680 Palaki Heritage Site. Uh, and they've
00:10:04.000 got some wonderfully restored and
00:10:05.760 preserved pictographs. Is it public
00:10:07.680 land? Behind behind the fence there, is
00:10:10.160 that public land? No. Immediately behind
00:10:11.920 the fence is a strange fence with
00:10:14.160 warning signs. Do not trespass. And and
00:10:16.079 it's very menacing. And what's the
00:10:18.160 purpose of that land? Officially,
00:10:20.560 officially it's a preserve for Native
00:10:22.959 American antiquity. Though, if you go in
00:10:24.480 that canyon, there's no Native American
00:10:25.920 antiquity. So, you've been in there.
00:10:27.760 Both of you have been in there and done
00:10:29.200 a reconnaissance of that entire canyon.
00:10:31.200 Yes. There's only a few pictographs on
00:10:33.440 the wall and that's it. There's nothing
00:10:34.480 else in there. So, it's being preserved
00:10:38.640 for heritage, but there's no heritage
00:10:41.120 there to be preserved. No. So, what do
00:10:43.440 you think they're really hiding? There's
00:10:45.200 something in there of grand importance
00:10:46.800 that I think is going to sound off truly
00:10:49.680 bizarre, but I think there is a portal
00:10:51.120 site in there. And that portal site has
00:10:53.279 been contained by the federal government
00:10:55.040 because they probably can't contain or
00:10:57.200 control it. So, the best next thing to
00:10:58.800 do is to contain it. A portal site. a
00:11:00.880 portal. What do you mean a portal site?
00:11:02.640 Um, a void where the physical conditions
00:11:05.519 or geoysical conditions are just right
00:11:07.600 where a void opens up and sometimes
00:11:09.519 under control of entities that aren't
00:11:11.839 earthbound entities and I think they can
00:11:13.360 use it at will to come here and and go
00:11:15.120 back to where they come from. So, there
00:11:16.720 was something else about this guy that
00:11:18.079 you saw cuz you photographed him with
00:11:19.839 your long lens, didn't you? I did. What
00:11:22.320 did you capture?
00:11:23.920 So we I captured him walking up this
00:11:26.880 lane here and um you could see he was
00:11:29.920 wearing a radio, a very large radio and
00:11:33.440 after Jeremiah talked to one of his
00:11:35.279 friends um he discovered that it was a
00:11:38.320 What sort of radio was it? This is the
00:11:40.000 truly bizarre thing Ross in relation to
00:11:41.760 what we were just talking about next
00:11:42.880 door. So here's someone that's clearly
00:11:44.560 posing as US Forest Service wearing body
00:11:47.600 armor. Wearing body armor. A pistol. And
00:11:49.519 a pistol. And he had actually gotten
00:11:51.440 dressed so quickly that his trousers
00:11:52.959 were actually half tucked into one sock,
00:11:54.399 which you can see in the photo. Uh but
00:11:56.320 on his back as he got frustrated, he was
00:11:58.320 trying to find us, he tracked us and
00:12:00.079 lost us right at the base of the cliff.
00:12:01.519 Never occurred to look up. So we were
00:12:02.959 about 80 ft above him looking down. And
00:12:04.800 we were actually able to duck even
00:12:05.920 behind the rock as as he was walking
00:12:07.519 away in case he did look back up at us.
00:12:09.200 But there's nothing illegal with you
00:12:10.480 being up there, is No, absolutely not.
00:12:11.760 This this side here, there's a famous
00:12:13.120 pictograph panel there. There's no
00:12:15.040 reason to even go there and ask. Why
00:12:17.279 would the Forest Service, if he was
00:12:19.120 Forest Service, why would they even be
00:12:20.399 worried? People are allowed to come in
00:12:21.760 here. It's Forgive me for saying this,
00:12:23.519 but it's public land. People own it. I
00:12:25.839 think they were worried that we crossed
00:12:26.880 the fence next door. And so they were
00:12:28.880 They know you and Alexandra have jumped
00:12:30.800 the fence on I'm certain that they knew
00:12:32.160 we'd been over that fence before. They
00:12:33.920 probably recognized the plate on our
00:12:35.519 car. And what was it about the radio
00:12:37.279 that your friend told? The radio was the
00:12:38.880 most interesting thing. So we
00:12:39.839 photographed him as he was frustrated
00:12:41.279 walking away. And uh as I was sending
00:12:44.480 the pictures of the radio to different
00:12:45.920 friends, one man was able to identify
00:12:47.360 it. And he was a member of the 72nd or
00:12:49.440 75th Ranger Regiment. He said it's a
00:12:51.440 special forces radio. And the only way
00:12:53.839 that it works is to encrypt anything
00:12:55.680 that's that's said or transmitted from
00:12:57.279 that radio to another radio that's set
00:12:59.279 and programmed to receive that radio.
00:13:01.040 Nobody else can hear it. So it's a bit
00:13:02.480 more than the average kit for a Forest
00:13:04.399 Service ranger. Absolutely. Begs the
00:13:07.120 question, why are they so worried about
00:13:09.200 you going in there? There's something
00:13:10.639 there they don't want us to see.
00:13:21.680 We're now on public land or private
00:13:23.839 land? This is public land. Public land.
00:13:25.839 Where does the government secret land
00:13:28.480 start? I'll show you. So, when you're
00:13:30.399 looking over uh behind us here, you'll
00:13:32.800 see a little bit of a white rooftop
00:13:34.480 right above the trees there. See, that's
00:13:36.240 Hartwell Canyon. Um that's part of the
00:13:38.639 old Hancock property. that right in
00:13:40.720 front of that house is a long fence
00:13:42.160 that's actually bolted in to the but in
00:13:43.920 front of us to the left. It goes all the
00:13:45.279 way across the canyon and bolted into
00:13:46.639 the red rock on the other side. So that
00:13:48.320 whole canyon's been blocked off. It's
00:13:49.760 been blocked off. Why? Uh there's nobody
00:13:52.000 living there. This is a good question.
00:13:53.360 This is one of the standing questions.
00:13:54.880 It's also now government property. Um
00:13:57.600 one of the official and I laugh because
00:13:59.519 one of the official statements that we
00:14:00.720 could find on it is it's a nature
00:14:02.120 preservancy. There's nothing in there.
00:14:03.920 It's a it's an empty canyon. Um there
00:14:06.000 there are some some uh Anastasia sites
00:14:09.199 in there with petroglyphs and and
00:14:10.800 pictographs, but aside from that,
00:14:12.639 there's nothing that would give you any
00:14:14.079 idea that it needs to be blocked off
00:14:15.839 with a fence and declared government
00:14:17.839 property or a nature preserve. Now, you
00:14:19.360 think there's a tunnel under here, don't
00:14:20.800 you? I do. Tell me where you think it
00:14:22.639 goes. I think it goes from right in
00:14:24.800 front of us here. This is one of the
00:14:25.839 better views you have of Secret
00:14:27.040 Mountain. So, this large precipice in
00:14:28.560 the center is the corner of Secret
00:14:30.240 Mountain. And the rumor was when we
00:14:32.480 started doing this investigation that
00:14:35.279 there's a very large military presence
00:14:37.760 under or some type of militaristic
00:14:39.920 presence under this mountain. And and
00:14:41.440 you say this with some authority because
00:14:43.360 you've come across soldiers with guns in
00:14:45.920 what is meant to be a a national park
00:14:47.600 area. We have and one of the the things
00:14:49.120 I really wanted to stress to press the
00:14:50.880 point for from our personal perspective
00:14:52.560 is in Boon Canyon which is also behind
00:14:54.959 us here. We went back on the same uh
00:14:57.920 reasoning, the same motive was to look
00:14:59.360 at a a pictograph and a panel of
00:15:02.000 pictographs and a structure, an onagasi
00:15:04.720 structure with a granary that was over
00:15:06.639 750 years old and it was about 600 ft up
00:15:08.800 on a cliff. We went back there, climbed
00:15:11.279 it, and while we were up there, we heard
00:15:13.120 uh voices from north of us in the
00:15:15.040 canyon. Again, there's nothing back
00:15:16.079 there. North in the canyon is the back
00:15:17.839 side of that mountain. Okay, to give you
00:15:19.839 perspective, it's on the other side
00:15:20.959 there. Uh we heard the voices stop. Then
00:15:24.079 we heard a loud metallic hollow boom. I
00:15:26.639 looked down at her. She was down the
00:15:28.000 rope on the on the cliff below. I said,
00:15:29.279 "Did you hear that?" And she said,
00:15:30.320 "Yes." And I started to climb down
00:15:32.079 toward her and then we heard the voices
00:15:33.440 again. Two voices. Then we heard a loud
00:15:35.839 metallic boom again. A hollow thump. And
00:15:38.160 you have to understand is remote.
00:15:39.839 There's no trail going back in there. Is
00:15:41.279 remote. The last sounded like a metal
00:15:43.199 door closing. Yes. Absolutely. And it's
00:15:45.600 not the last thing you'd expect to hear
00:15:46.800 back there. Voices for the first place.
00:15:48.480 There's nobody back there. struck us as
00:15:50.720 funny because we went the only way in
00:15:52.079 which was in a dry wash with sand. There
00:15:53.680 was no footprints or anything. Uh we
00:15:55.920 heard that twice and then we decided
00:15:58.000 well let's get get out of here. We can't
00:15:59.680 explain it. So uh as we were leaving I
00:16:02.160 took a good scan of the area and we came
00:16:05.519 back uh a week later and that week later
00:16:09.279 to get context of the story we we uh
00:16:11.519 went to the same site with a better
00:16:13.040 camera and we photographed again the
00:16:15.040 pictographs that we saw the Anastasia
00:16:17.320 dwelling. And when we were coming back
00:16:19.199 down, I noticed something was strange.
00:16:20.639 And this is during the CO closure. And a
00:16:23.360 person we know that works at the head of
00:16:24.560 the canyon said within that week when we
00:16:26.480 were first in the canyon and that this
00:16:28.639 particular day I'm speaking of that
00:16:30.240 Apache helicopters with a full
00:16:32.079 complement of rockets had flown into the
00:16:33.600 canyon and they heard an explosion right
00:16:36.000 back here at the end of Boon Canyon. Uh
00:16:38.399 I put that in the back of my mind when
00:16:40.000 we went back there. But as we were
00:16:41.120 coming back down, I saw an avalanche and
00:16:43.199 the avalanche was covering the same area
00:16:44.639 where we heard the voices and the
00:16:45.839 metallic boom. And so I thought that's
00:16:47.680 peculiar. My my mind started turning.
00:16:49.360 Then I thought, I wonder if somebody's
00:16:50.720 actually engaging to shut down the rear
00:16:53.120 entrance of a bunker. And Alex, you've
00:16:54.800 taken photographs, haven't you, of
00:16:56.240 Apache helicopters over Sedona? Yes, we
00:16:58.480 have. Following what? It looked like a
00:17:01.759 UFO. A disc. Yes, it looked like a
00:17:04.640 silver disc. And you can show us that
00:17:06.240 photo. Yes, we can.
00:17:08.640 So I believe in you know relation to
00:17:11.199 that these helicopters operate from in
00:17:13.679 general this area and the sycamore basin
00:17:15.280 which is immediately behind you. But
00:17:17.199 again with the focus being this secret
00:17:18.880 mountain area the rear of Boon Canyon
00:17:20.720 where we were hearing these voices uh is
00:17:23.359 is one of the the things that really
00:17:25.039 struck us because in in Boon Canyon is
00:17:27.119 one of the most popular resorts in the
00:17:28.480 area. So when we came back a week later
00:17:30.559 to look at a a relatively strange
00:17:32.799 anomaly which was a um what you call
00:17:34.880 well an avalanche. There was an
00:17:35.760 avalanche in an area that there wasn't
00:17:37.120 the previous week. We thought instead of
00:17:39.200 climbing up there, we'll fly our drone
00:17:40.480 to it. So, we return another week later.
00:17:42.400 So, we're 3 weeks after we first heard
00:17:44.240 the voices and we go back. We put the
00:17:46.799 drone up three times, I believe it was.
00:17:48.640 We got three flights looking at this
00:17:50.080 area with a strange avalanche anomaly.
00:17:52.480 We're satisfied that we got good video
00:17:53.919 of it. The sun was down over the the
00:17:56.160 west wall of the canyon. So, we packed
00:17:57.600 up and we're leaving. And I remembered
00:17:59.600 some anazi circles in stone that was in
00:18:01.440 a thicket on one side of the canyon. So,
00:18:03.120 we left the dry wash, which is the
00:18:04.799 quickest way out, climbed up into this
00:18:06.400 thicket where in places you have to duck
00:18:07.919 because the trees are so thick. Now,
00:18:09.360 mind you too, it's dark now as we're
00:18:10.799 going through there. The only light we
00:18:12.080 have is ambient starlight. And I was
00:18:13.919 ahead of her by about eight paces. And I
00:18:15.840 thought I saw even though I was tired,
00:18:17.679 somebody running in black from my right
00:18:19.840 to left. And I just put that on my mind.
00:18:22.000 I didn't even call back to her saying
00:18:23.120 there's somebody ahead of us because I
00:18:24.080 thought I'm tired. I'm seeing things.
00:18:25.919 And right about where that person
00:18:27.600 disappeared is where I came upon the
00:18:28.960 circles on the ground. So, I'm tired. I
00:18:30.960 told her, "Can you get p pictures of
00:18:32.000 this so we can document it and then
00:18:33.120 we'll get out of here." She took her
00:18:34.559 camera out. She held it up and pointed
00:18:36.559 in the direction that we saw this man,
00:18:38.400 turned on the flash. She got the first
00:18:40.360 photo, panned down, second photo, took a
00:18:43.280 step back, and she put the camera up
00:18:44.799 again, looking straight ahead of her.
00:18:46.320 And in queue with the third photo, a
00:18:47.760 rifle went off right behind us. It was a
00:18:49.520 suppressed 5.56 rifle. And we both
00:18:52.160 jumped in the air and shrugged. I could
00:18:54.080 hear a deer running through the brush.
00:18:55.280 They were scared, too. And I turned and
00:18:56.960 looked at her and she said, "That was a
00:18:58.080 rifle." Nice. Now, let's be clear.
00:18:59.600 You're on public land at that stage.
00:19:00.880 Public land. Yes. So, that's if there
00:19:02.799 was a soldier, that's illegal. Yes.
00:19:04.480 Absolutely illegal. Crime. Yes. So, we
00:19:06.720 ran. Illegal to hunt after sundown. And
00:19:09.840 mind you, we were several hours off
00:19:13.280 trail. So, what'd you do? We ran. They
00:19:15.679 just ran. They ran for it, which is what
00:19:17.679 they wanted obviously. Yeah, I believe.
00:19:19.120 So, I believe it does beg the question,
00:19:20.960 though, if somebody's firing a rifle to
00:19:22.880 try and get you out of there, they don't
00:19:24.799 want you there, do they? They don't want
00:19:26.080 you to see something, right? And I I
00:19:27.600 really we thought about it after. I
00:19:28.720 thought if they put some sort of
00:19:29.679 blocking team in there, they were
00:19:31.120 probably going to confront us in the dry
00:19:32.480 wash. I think they weren't expecting us
00:19:34.160 to leave the dry wash and they probably
00:19:36.080 had a flankman who wasn't expecting us
00:19:38.080 to come through there. The nearest known
00:19:40.400 defense installation near Sedona is in
00:19:42.880 Phoenix, which is 2 hours away. So there
00:19:45.679 shouldn't be any defense facility here.
00:19:47.919 No. No. And legally, if they're trying
00:19:50.799 to protect people, I mean, I think it's
00:19:52.640 important there are defense facilities.
00:19:54.160 They have to be protected. we do need to
00:19:56.160 respect national security. So if there
00:19:58.320 is a defense facility here, we don't
00:19:59.919 want to breach national security. But
00:20:01.919 surely they'd put up signs saying,
00:20:03.919 "Don't come in here. This is a defense
00:20:05.679 department
00:20:06.600 installation." The thing that puzzles me
00:20:08.799 though, Alex, is you've described an
00:20:10.960 incident where you saw a disc being
00:20:14.799 accompanied by or pursued by
00:20:16.480 helicopters. Tell me what you saw. So we
00:20:18.880 were in our backyard and we had just
00:20:20.799 been camping the night before. driving
00:20:23.120 back from camping in our neighborhood.
00:20:25.440 We saw an Apache helicopter pretty close
00:20:28.320 to the ground and it was just hovering
00:20:30.480 there and then it circled around and
00:20:32.559 then came back to the same spot and was
00:20:34.080 hovering and we thought they must be
00:20:35.760 looking for something. That's strange.
00:20:38.080 And then we dismissed it. We went home.
00:20:40.159 We were outside in the backyard and then
00:20:42.559 we hear helicopters coming. So, what
00:20:44.320 time of day? It was approximately 10,
00:20:47.360 just after 10:00 a.m. So, it's the
00:20:49.200 morning clear day. Morning clear day.
00:20:51.600 What do you see? So, we see seven Apache
00:20:55.200 helicopters fly overhead and we took a
00:20:59.200 picture with what we had with us, which
00:21:00.799 was just an iPad. Um, but you can see in
00:21:04.000 the photograph, which we'll provide to
00:21:05.840 you, you'll see a silver UAP of some
00:21:08.240 sort. They were following it or chasing
00:21:11.200 it. Looked like the helicopters were
00:21:13.200 escorting it. I It's just amazing to me
00:21:15.840 how overt the the activity seems to be.
00:21:19.679 What do they expect that locals aren't
00:21:21.039 going to notice? That was right over
00:21:22.559 West Sedona. That's the most populated
00:21:23.919 part of town.
00:21:35.280 The sign here says that this is the
00:21:37.600 Southwest Experimental Garden Array or
00:21:40.000 SEGA, some kind of research project from
00:21:42.480 Northern Arizona University as part of a
00:21:45.760 thing permitted by the Forests
00:21:47.360 Department. So, it's not a military
00:21:49.760 facility at all. It's a scientific
00:21:51.440 project. Have we got it wrong? Well,
00:21:53.600 that's what they're saying. There's a
00:21:54.799 Southwest experimental garden array seo
00:21:57.919 um by NAU, but the
00:22:01.320 locals know that something else is going
00:22:03.840 on. So, that's more of a cover story.
00:22:05.600 And how do they know that? observations,
00:22:08.960 encounters with um military personnel,
00:22:12.159 people in white coveralls,
00:22:14.640 um strange things that they've seen here
00:22:16.880 at the ranch. Like, well, when this was
00:22:20.000 first um bought by Northern Arizona,
00:22:24.000 Northern Arizona University, there were
00:22:26.480 military men up at Bradshaw null um
00:22:29.919 guarding the entrance to the drive down.
00:22:32.960 So, no, where we are right now, is this
00:22:36.080 public land? This is This is But that's
00:22:38.880 the Bradshaw Ranch. Yes. And that's now
00:22:41.120 owned by the government.
00:22:44.240 Yes. Northern Arizona University is
00:22:46.640 leasing it from the government. Right.
00:22:49.039 Do you buy the cover story, Jeremiah,
00:22:51.520 that this is a experiment to discover
00:22:54.080 the ability of plants and animals to
00:22:55.760 adapt to climate change 12 years ago?
00:22:58.400 Absolutely. Now, absolutely not. Why?
00:23:00.799 What's changed? What's made you realize
00:23:02.240 that it's not what it is? Observation.
00:23:04.159 Ross, we've been coming here almost
00:23:05.840 every weekend, uh, sometimes twice a
00:23:07.760 week for approximately 12 years, almost
00:23:09.840 12 years of this coming August. And we
00:23:11.919 have never seen students from NAU. We
00:23:14.320 have never seen a van from NA with
00:23:16.240 people in it, nor a professor checking
00:23:18.080 up on the project. So, if it's a
00:23:19.520 university project, nobody's doing any
00:23:21.360 research. Nobody's doing anything. You
00:23:22.640 would expect to see at some point
00:23:24.000 somebody physically altering or even
00:23:26.559 working or documenting something here,
00:23:27.840 and we've never seen any of that. So,
00:23:29.120 tell me about the fence. Why is the
00:23:30.480 fence significant? You were told
00:23:32.159 something about the fence, weren't you?
00:23:33.520 I think the fence personally is
00:23:34.799 significant for several reasons. Um,
00:23:36.799 first by observation, I bought a friend
00:23:38.480 who was stationed at Fort Knox. Uh,
00:23:40.640 complete skeptic. Didn't think that
00:23:41.840 anything abnormal was going on here
00:23:43.200 until he looked at the positioning of
00:23:44.400 the fence and the cameras inside. He
00:23:47.039 first told me that when he was at Fort
00:23:48.720 Knox, they had fences like this on
00:23:50.400 certain portions of the post. He looked
00:23:52.000 at the padlocks and said, "These are the
00:23:53.360 same padlocks that the government buys,
00:23:54.799 cheap padlocks to lock things up." And
00:23:57.280 so, he wasn't surprised about that. But
00:23:58.559 he said, "I want to ask you something."
00:24:00.080 He said, "Look at the camera on the
00:24:01.440 tower." And so he drew my attention. If
00:24:03.280 you look over our shoulders here on the
00:24:05.520 tower there, you'll see a camera. The
00:24:07.280 camera's facing in, not out. He said,
00:24:09.520 "The same cameras, uh, such as these we
00:24:12.000 had at our post at Fort Knox, but of
00:24:13.760 course they face naturally to the fence
00:24:15.760 cuz you're looking for people breaking
00:24:16.880 in." To look for people breaking in. So
00:24:18.559 where's that camera pointing? That
00:24:19.840 camera is facing in. And it's fa facing
00:24:22.799 actually right where Linda Bradshaw
00:24:24.559 photographed the portal that she spoke
00:24:26.240 of and is now becoming very well talked
00:24:27.919 of. So help me here. Linda says or said
00:24:31.760 she saw something open in
00:24:33.919 threedimensional space, some kind of
00:24:35.760 portal. She liked to stand outside at
00:24:37.520 night with her dog. She was a night owl
00:24:39.200 and she enjoyed staying out and enjoying
00:24:40.799 the ambiance of the desert. But what's
00:24:42.320 the story about what she said she saw
00:24:45.279 happen when that portal appeared? So she
00:24:48.720 was in her kitchen at that time looking
00:24:50.400 out the kitchen window and she said that
00:24:52.640 she saw the portal open in the air. How
00:24:55.760 what did she say she saw? She saw a
00:24:58.080 glitter of light and she it caught her
00:24:59.840 attention. She looked up. Her dogs
00:25:01.120 actually saw it too. She had like five
00:25:02.799 of her ranch dogs with her and she she
00:25:05.200 paid attention to the dogs cuz the dogs
00:25:06.640 could sense things before she could
00:25:08.080 naturally. And the glitter light turned
00:25:09.840 in what she described as an octagonal
00:25:12.080 light which then grew into a rectangular
00:25:14.960 almost a movie screen like a drive-in
00:25:16.960 theater type uh opening. Through that
00:25:19.600 she saw daylight and in a brief moment
00:25:21.360 something flew through it. And just as
00:25:22.960 quick as something disappeared flying
00:25:24.480 through it, it closed up and was gone.
00:25:26.400 She thought to herself, "Now I'm ready.
00:25:27.760 If this happens again, I'm going to
00:25:29.440 capture it for posterity on film." It
00:25:31.679 did happen and she was ready for it. She
00:25:33.760 saw this glitter of light. She grabbed
00:25:35.120 her camera which was hanging around her
00:25:36.480 neck, got it up just in time to click
00:25:38.559 two frames and whatever it was was gone.
00:25:40.960 When she de developed the frame, she had
00:25:43.039 in fact a rectangular shape just like
00:25:45.440 she saw before with a disc, a classic
00:25:47.919 UFO or UAP type disc. She actually got a
00:25:50.159 photograph of the portal. She did. My
00:25:52.000 logical rational brain is saying this is
00:25:54.320 nonsense. This is a
00:25:56.600 delusion. It can't possibly be true. We
00:25:59.120 don't have things called portals.
00:26:02.400 Help me here. I will. Um, there's a
00:26:04.320 electrical engineer who's a friend of
00:26:05.600 mine. He's retired and he's dedicated
00:26:07.760 every ounce of his knowhow to make his
00:26:10.559 own equipment to come out here and and
00:26:12.159 test the geographical oddities in this
00:26:14.720 area. And we can kind of bring up the
00:26:16.960 the Sarin experiment in uh I believe
00:26:19.200 it's Switzerland. um they were
00:26:20.880 experimenting with uh their collider and
00:26:23.440 we have by my friend I can't name his
00:26:26.080 name but his own admission and his
00:26:27.440 research out here um very odd things
00:26:29.440 that happen through the ground here and
00:26:31.039 they can be measured by science and
00:26:33.279 there's a lot of uh empty cavities under
00:26:35.120 the ground here with uh water running
00:26:37.200 through them and cold air they create
00:26:39.360 friction which makes electrons and the
00:26:41.840 electrons are carrying positive and
00:26:43.279 negative ions up into the air and
00:26:45.360 they're attracted to each other and I'm
00:26:47.279 no scientist so I'm a lay person for
00:26:48.960 describing
00:26:50.080 But they attract each other to a point
00:26:51.840 where they collide. And when they
00:26:53.360 collide, that's when he says the magic
00:26:54.880 happens. But so he's thinking it's a
00:26:56.640 natural phenomenon. He thinks it's
00:26:57.840 natural. So he doesn't think there's
00:26:59.120 anything paranormal about it. No. But
00:27:01.120 what you're describing something some
00:27:02.799 object coming out of a square shaped
00:27:04.559 rectangular hole in three-dimensional
00:27:06.320 space. That's pretty paranormal in my
00:27:08.400 book. It's pretty paranormal and it's
00:27:09.679 it's enough to make somebody shake their
00:27:10.960 head. So absolutely not. It's not
00:27:12.240 happening. And how many people have seen
00:27:13.600 that phenomenon at the Bradshaw Ranch? I
00:27:16.240 I can't count how many have actually
00:27:17.520 seen it here, but the the number of
00:27:18.960 anomalies that people have witnessed
00:27:20.320 here, aside from portals, and some
00:27:22.000 people have claimed to see a portal
00:27:23.039 here, um are probably into the hundreds
00:27:25.679 now. So, what you're saying you I mean,
00:27:29.120 I need a bit of help here, cuz this is a
00:27:31.480 huge to accept.
00:27:34.000 You're saying not only is this a secret
00:27:35.679 military base where we assume they're
00:27:38.480 working on something perhaps reverse
00:27:40.720 engineering retrieved non-human
00:27:42.760 technology, it's also the site of a
00:27:44.960 paranormal location. Very much so. Very
00:27:47.360 much so. It's become one of the most uh
00:27:49.520 talked of hot spots in Arizona. In fact,
00:27:51.679 you were part of a group from the Beyond
00:27:53.919 Skinwalker TV series, weren't you? Yes.
00:27:56.080 And did they pick up anomalies here when
00:27:57.760 they were here? They did. Um they came
00:27:59.360 at a at a good time right before they
00:28:00.799 came. In fact, this place was coming
00:28:02.080 alive, which is the term that we've used
00:28:03.760 with activity from um like poltergeist
00:28:07.200 activity, things moving in the house, um
00:28:10.080 strange sounds, howls on the property.
00:28:12.159 Uh what did they detect? Did they detect
00:28:14.320 anything scientifically? They did. Um
00:28:16.240 they brought equipment with them that
00:28:17.279 had never been deployed before. One of
00:28:19.039 the uh interesting toys, as they called
00:28:20.880 it, was a I believe a gamma ray camera.
00:28:23.039 Forgive me guys if I'm calling it the
00:28:24.399 wrong name, but they had never deployed
00:28:25.840 it before and they brought it out here
00:28:27.279 for the first time. They set it up down
00:28:29.279 the fence here on uh the western side of
00:28:32.080 the property looking through the fence
00:28:33.919 toward where Linda Bradshaw saw her
00:28:35.840 portal. And interestingly enough uh at
00:28:38.559 nighttime they caught an immense amount
00:28:40.240 of of gamma rays radiation in the shape
00:28:42.880 of a rectangle about in the exact same
00:28:45.679 spot and altitude above the ground where
00:28:47.840 Linda photographed the portal. Okay. So,
00:28:49.840 this is a bit of a stretch here for my
00:28:52.240 very skeptical brain, but you think the
00:28:55.279 reason why the US has put a fence around
00:28:57.200 this and called it a scientific
00:28:59.360 university research project is because
00:29:01.200 they're hiding something paranormal that
00:29:02.880 they're researching. I think so. I I
00:29:04.640 think if you look at it from a from a a
00:29:06.559 military perspective or a tactical
00:29:08.240 perspective, if you've got a door that
00:29:09.679 you can't control and something with
00:29:11.600 great immense uh technology that's been
00:29:14.320 advanced well well above our own, you
00:29:16.480 know, maybe let's say a thousand years
00:29:17.679 ahead of our own, you want that
00:29:19.279 technology for one thing. You want to
00:29:20.720 reverse engineer it. But how do you
00:29:22.480 capture it? Well, the best way to do
00:29:24.000 that would be to to seize the sites
00:29:25.679 where these doors are that you can't
00:29:27.120 control and wait on the other side. And
00:29:29.279 if you can get these these pieces of
00:29:30.880 technology, well, let's look at it two
00:29:32.720 ways. It's also a national security
00:29:34.000 threat to have a door that you can't
00:29:35.200 control on your own in your own country.
00:29:37.279 So for the sake of the American people,
00:29:39.200 it makes sense if there is a door that
00:29:42.000 comes from another dimension or from
00:29:43.760 across space time and space to seize
00:29:46.000 that property and for the sake of safety
00:29:48.240 secure it. You are doing my hidden
00:29:50.559 Jeremiah. I I imagine so. I imagine so.
00:29:53.200 Then then look at it from a perspective
00:29:54.799 from R&D. There are people in Russia,
00:29:57.840 people in China, and certainly people in
00:29:59.279 our military-industrial complex that
00:30:00.880 would kill. And I mean literally kill to
00:30:03.679 have that technology. Now, the thing I
00:30:06.240 find interesting is this ranch is
00:30:07.760 supposedly empty, isn't it? Yes. But I
00:30:10.960 just happened to notice there's a huge
00:30:12.640 electrical junction box about 50 ft up
00:30:14.720 in the foliage there. Yes. Did you hear
00:30:16.799 it? It's humming. There's still juice in
00:30:18.559 it. Somebody's getting electricity into
00:30:20.240 this site. Somebody's getting
00:30:21.200 electricity here for some reason.
00:30:22.480 Where's that electricity going? I don't
00:30:24.080 know. Probably underground. Now, you
00:30:25.840 believe, don't you, from your research
00:30:27.919 that there's some kind of tunnel? Yes.
00:30:30.559 And again, this is doing my head in, but
00:30:32.320 I'm I'm coming with it. Let me go with
00:30:33.919 it. You believe there's a tunnel from
00:30:37.360 some kind of base in those cliffs there,
00:30:39.840 right across to the Clarkdale Cement
00:30:41.600 Works? Yes. What basis do you have for
00:30:44.240 saying that? Again, I have to tip my hat
00:30:46.080 to uh Brandon Fugel's team who were just
00:30:48.559 a gem when they were here. They were so
00:30:49.919 professional. They had a another
00:30:51.840 contractor group called Terara. And
00:30:53.279 Terara came out with drone penetrating
00:30:54.880 radar, which they attached to a drone,
00:30:56.640 and they were mowing the lawn, so to
00:30:58.399 speak, back and forth. They have a good
00:31:00.080 pattern that's pre-programmed. We
00:31:01.600 weren't here when they did it. Didn't
00:31:02.880 even know that they had accomplished
00:31:04.559 this uh this feat. But they first asked
00:31:06.399 me where I believe the tunnel was. And I
00:31:08.320 gave them a relative idea on a map where
00:31:09.840 I thought the tunnel would be. And
00:31:11.679 unbeknownst to me, they actually brought
00:31:13.679 the the guys from Teran to prove yes,
00:31:15.840 there is a tunnel here or no, there
00:31:17.399 isn't. They say in point of fact, they
00:31:19.600 did find a tunnel. It was about 50 ft in
00:31:21.279 diameter in a straight line. And they
00:31:24.159 they asked the the guys from Terra who
00:31:26.080 are s professional. This is what they
00:31:27.679 do. They said, "Could that be natural?"
00:31:29.440 And they said, "No, we've seen man-made
00:31:31.120 tunnels before, and that's what a
00:31:32.559 man-made tunnel looks like." I guess one
00:31:34.159 way of testing it would be to see
00:31:36.159 whether we can find the place where you
00:31:38.559 believe there is a tunnel. Yes. And we
00:31:41.120 do have a good friend of mine, Paul,
00:31:43.679 who's an Australian treasure hunter, who
00:31:45.679 happens to have a ground penetrating.
00:31:47.760 Fantastic. So, we'll bring him in here
00:31:50.240 and see what he can find.
00:31:58.960 Hey there, buddy. Hey, mate. Let's get
00:32:00.559 the kid out. Good to see you. Same here.
00:32:06.080 Uh, why don't you meet Jeremiah and
00:32:08.159 Alexander? Pleased to meet you. Nice to
00:32:10.320 meet you. So, Jeremiah's got some
00:32:11.600 interesting places we want to put your
00:32:13.120 GPR over. Cool. In a short distance
00:32:15.799 here, we should be able to detect some
00:32:18.960 type of underground
00:32:20.440 cavity, which should in fact be the 50
00:32:23.200 foot diameter
00:32:25.080 tunnel. Okay, Ross, this is this is the
00:32:27.360 area I was thinking of. If Terara's line
00:32:29.440 is true and straight between where we're
00:32:31.519 standing now and roughly that bush on
00:32:33.200 the right hand side of the land, we
00:32:34.240 should pick up some sort of cavity or
00:32:35.919 anomaly under the under us here. So,
00:32:37.519 they're saying they found a tunnel? Yes.
00:32:39.360 Like a constructed tunnel underneath
00:32:41.360 here. A 50ft diameter man-made tunnel.
00:32:44.080 Why in heaven's name would anybody build
00:32:45.840 a tunnel out here in the desert? That's
00:32:47.519 the question. Look, there's only one way
00:32:49.440 to find out.
00:32:52.000 So, Paul, what can we do with your
00:32:54.880 device? I can pick up cavities and
00:32:56.960 voids. I can pick up metal. I can pick
00:32:59.039 up ferrris metal and non- ferrris metal.
00:33:02.720 Okay. Well, let's give it a go and see
00:33:03.919 what we find. Okay.
00:33:11.679 That's the spot. That's the spot I
00:33:13.360 picked up in the silent imagery that I
00:33:14.799 thought that the uh the tunnel would
00:33:16.240 continue to the north. I suppose they're
00:33:17.840 probably using metal in the concrete
00:33:19.200 reinforcing, aren't they? I would think
00:33:20.399 so. Yeah, maybe rebar or something. I'm
00:33:23.440 getting really strong metal right there.
00:33:28.480 So again, for me, this is a little bit
00:33:30.799 more of indication because looking at
00:33:32.080 the satellite imagery on Google Earth
00:33:34.159 Pro, if one continues the line from
00:33:36.799 where Terra uncovered 50ft section of
00:33:39.120 tunnel moving towards Secret Mountain in
00:33:41.440 a straight line, it passes through this
00:33:42.880 very corner of the fence moving this way
00:33:44.799 due north. So what are we looking at
00:33:46.080 here, Paul? Look at the picture on here.
00:33:48.000 It's a three-dimensional image. just
00:33:49.440 showing a cavity with a metal object at
00:33:52.799 um 4% which means the metal object's not
00:33:54.960 that very big and not that very deep.
00:33:57.279 But that big green thing there is the
00:33:58.880 cavity. That's the cavity. I mean that's
00:34:00.720 that's a rectangle or a square. That may
00:34:03.440 be the that may be the way how this is
00:34:05.279 configured. But that's a fairly big
00:34:06.559 cavity
00:34:08.639 and it's right underneath us. You can
00:34:10.000 see the word there cavity. Incredible.
00:34:11.599 This is the exact spot that I picked as
00:34:13.199 my primary target here. The exact spot
00:34:15.040 standing right over it.
00:34:17.280 Actually makes me a bit nervous. knowing
00:34:19.119 this now.
00:34:22.480 So the whole area that you scanned here
00:34:24.480 No, I've just scanned right here. I've
00:34:26.560 only scanned about 3ft area here and
00:34:29.280 it's given me a cavity with metal
00:34:30.800 object. Okay. Yeah. Not very deep and
00:34:32.879 not very big. Maybe about 4 to 7 in and
00:34:36.480 maybe about that same depth. Now it's
00:34:39.760 probably a little bit deeper. It's
00:34:40.800 probably about a foot, maybe 2T deep.
00:34:42.960 You can go from the top to there. That
00:34:45.760 could probably be 3T deep.
00:34:48.879 Not very deep at all. You got a cavity
00:34:50.560 with metal object in it 3T down. I mean,
00:34:53.440 could it be that there's some kind of
00:34:55.000 underground concrete that was put in
00:34:56.960 when they built the house? That's
00:34:58.160 possible. I won't rule that out. But
00:35:00.320 that doesn't explain the cavity. No, it
00:35:02.240 doesn't. It doesn't. And how big is the
00:35:04.400 cavity cavity ball?
00:35:08.160 You can't. It's at least like from there
00:35:10.560 to there, it have to be at least 8t.
00:35:13.520 Oh, right. Okay. Right. So, that's a big
00:35:15.359 hole. That's a fairly big screen of
00:35:16.800 cavity.
00:35:19.760 So you're getting a stronger signal now.
00:35:21.359 Yeah. In the same spot. It might have
00:35:23.440 been a couple of inches either side that
00:35:25.359 vary it. And do you think that cuz your
00:35:27.440 device can only go down 15 ft max,
00:35:29.520 right? At best. Yeah. So you're possibly
00:35:31.680 skimming the top of a cavity. Either
00:35:34.079 skimming the top of a big cavity or a
00:35:37.680 smaller cavity that's not very deep. The
00:35:40.079 fact that it's given me cavities and
00:35:41.440 giving me the the picture of it all and
00:35:43.119 the shape and everything, right? But
00:35:44.560 it's also identifying metal.
00:35:47.119 And is that unusual? I mean, there would
00:35:48.800 be metal in the ground, wouldn't there?
00:35:50.079 Well, why is there metal in a cavity? It
00:35:52.160 makes me wonder too if it's a natural
00:35:54.000 cavity. Yeah.
00:35:56.079 The only metal you'd find is probably
00:35:57.680 gold or you to find steel in a in a
00:36:00.560 natural cavity. No, that doesn't make
00:36:02.480 sense. If it was rebar reinforcing
00:36:05.040 concrete tubing, would that be picked up
00:36:07.599 in that manner? It would be, but the
00:36:09.200 shape's all wrong. It's more like a a
00:36:11.280 diamond shape. It's an amazing thought
00:36:13.440 that there might be a a concrete tunnel.
00:36:16.560 Yes. You know, a few meters underneath
00:36:18.079 us. It's borderline science fiction, but
00:36:20.000 with Sedona, it seems like science
00:36:21.359 fiction more often meets reality. So,
00:36:23.440 where we're going next is the Clarkdale
00:36:25.680 Cement Factory. Yes. And there's a very
00:36:27.920 interesting story behind that. It does
00:36:29.760 specifically because Martin Marietta
00:36:31.440 owns it. And who are they? Martin
00:36:33.760 Marriott is an incredibly large and
00:36:35.760 wellunded defense contractor linked to
00:36:38.960 linked to um Skunk Works. Lockheed. Yes.
00:36:42.640 Loheed Martin. Yes. Oh my goodness. This
00:36:45.839 just gets better and better.
00:36:57.680 We're sitting right above the Clarkdale
00:37:00.400 cement plant and we've traversed a whole
00:37:03.920 lot of points between Secret Mountain
00:37:06.400 way over there. What's that? 17 miles
00:37:08.400 about 17 miles.
00:37:10.560 What conclusions can we reach? There's
00:37:13.040 something very bizarre is going on here.
00:37:14.960 Because if you were to factor in the
00:37:17.359 amount of cost it would take to put
00:37:19.200 something underground from this factory
00:37:21.040 all the way up to Secret Mountain in a
00:37:22.480 straight line even, that shows that
00:37:24.480 somebody's got a lot of funding to do
00:37:26.880 it. Almost unlimited funds to make
00:37:28.240 something. Assuming that's true. Yes.
00:37:30.079 Assuming it's true. I mean, it's a hell
00:37:31.680 of a thing. I mean, I I can't conceive
00:37:33.119 of any tunnel that's 17 mi long that's
00:37:36.240 that big, 50 ft wide. Yes. It it will
00:37:39.119 warrant a little bit more digging
00:37:40.240 because we know now that there's
00:37:41.359 something under the Bradshaw ranch. We
00:37:43.119 know there's a void there. We know
00:37:44.240 there's a 50 foot diameter tunnel. But
00:37:46.000 you actually think that Clark down there
00:37:48.160 is being used as a an entry point. I I I
00:37:51.040 strongly believe that that's one of the
00:37:52.240 entry points. Yes. So just tell me about
00:37:54.079 the hills behind the cement plant here
00:37:56.240 cuz there's there's also I understand
00:37:58.000 old copper mines where we're standing.
00:37:59.680 Yes. Uh there's a lot of copper taken
00:38:01.280 out of this uh the mines along this
00:38:02.960 whole mountain range here. Um, we're
00:38:04.640 standing roughly on the side of
00:38:05.680 Woodshoot Mountain and the anomalous
00:38:08.240 activity that's been coming out of these
00:38:09.760 hills as of recently from approximately
00:38:12.000 September 27th to current times has been
00:38:14.720 off the charts almost every night. Um,
00:38:16.800 and you can almost mark your watch by
00:38:18.640 these orange and amber balls coming up
00:38:21.760 out of the basin. They're being met by
00:38:24.079 Blackhop helicopters flown virtually
00:38:26.079 right over where we're at now and over
00:38:27.280 the mountain. And how many people are
00:38:29.119 seeing this? Dozens, Ross. Dozens. In
00:38:31.839 fact, I understand Melinda Leslie's
00:38:33.440 sightseeing tours with night vision
00:38:35.200 goggles. See them almost every night.
00:38:36.960 Almost every night. She she called us
00:38:38.720 one night and she was very excited. She
00:38:40.320 said, "Can you get down here?" And
00:38:41.760 luckily that night we were free. So we
00:38:43.599 joined her and we drove down a road here
00:38:45.680 called Bill Grey Road. She parked the
00:38:47.760 car, passed out the night vision, and we
00:38:49.839 no sooner got them up to our eyes and we
00:38:51.440 counted 17 Blackhawks. 17
00:38:54.640 whereabouts. They were right here in
00:38:56.079 front of us in the basin and they were
00:38:58.000 spaced at intervals uh like they were
00:39:00.320 waiting for something. Within moments of
00:39:02.480 watching these helicopters which were
00:39:03.920 stationary, they were hovering. Um just
00:39:05.920 as Melinda had described a amber ball of
00:39:08.320 light came up from right below us here
00:39:10.320 and the first two helicopters on our
00:39:12.160 immediate left which would have been on
00:39:14.000 the on the west side of the this array
00:39:15.920 of helicopters broke away, met the amber
00:39:19.119 ball and followed it up over the
00:39:20.320 mountain here. So, you think there's
00:39:22.000 something going on involving the
00:39:23.760 military in this valley? I do. And it's
00:39:26.560 underground. Yes. And I have to say, I
00:39:30.240 wish I could just dismiss out of hand
00:39:32.640 because logic dictates we should be
00:39:35.560 skeptical. It's very hard to dismiss out
00:39:38.000 of hand when you look at the evidence
00:39:39.280 you've shown us today.
00:39:41.760 And over time too, we we tend to look at
00:39:44.320 things rather skeptically, less more,
00:39:46.320 you know, so now, but um over time when
00:39:49.359 you see these things repeatedly and it
00:39:50.800 happens over and over again, the doubt
00:39:52.240 goes away in your mind and you start to
00:39:53.680 have a solid bit of evidence in your
00:39:55.200 mind from your own personal experience
00:39:56.800 of what you're seeing and you know,
00:39:58.960 number one, you're seeing helicopters,
00:40:00.400 very expensive helicopters almost every
00:40:02.160 night and then something anomalous that
00:40:03.839 you can't explain with those
00:40:04.960 helicopters. Jeremiah, you concede
00:40:06.960 there's also the possibility that
00:40:08.400 there's something paranormal here.
00:40:10.880 Absolutely. Absolutely. If it's not
00:40:13.280 ours, then it means it's something
00:40:14.880 intelligently driven, far advanced of
00:40:16.880 our own technology, and it's here for
00:40:18.800 some reason. And it appears here much
00:40:21.280 more regularly than a lot of other
00:40:22.720 places. And so that begs the question,
00:40:24.640 why? Why here? Why not somewhere else?
00:40:26.800 Why not in an area like Groom Lake? I
00:40:28.880 mean, you can barely see it, but Sedona
00:40:31.760 is a a distant dot on the horizon here,
00:40:34.000 but it's slap bang right next to where
00:40:37.040 we're seeing all of this activity. I
00:40:39.520 still struggle to understand why a
00:40:41.280 military base would be put underground
00:40:43.359 in an area so close to a tourism venue.
00:40:45.839 Honestly, it seems illogical to me. It
00:40:47.599 seems very illogical. When you look at
00:40:49.040 Arizona as a whole, it's a sparsely
00:40:50.480 populated state. There's a lot more
00:40:52.240 unoccupied real estate in very rugged
00:40:54.240 places, more rugged even than this. You
00:40:56.000 would think that that would be the ideal
00:40:57.200 place to put it. Alexandra, if it's
00:41:00.000 true, if there is, I mean, it's just
00:41:02.800 sounds incredible, but if it is true
00:41:04.560 that there's a deep underground military
00:41:06.880 bunker here that's doing things with
00:41:08.880 maybe reverse engineered non-human
00:41:11.040 technology, and my head explodes as I
00:41:13.280 say that, if that's true, we're in a a
00:41:17.920 completely new paradigm. I mean, you've
00:41:20.160 got a normal world and you've got this
00:41:22.400 world going on in the black right here.
00:41:24.960 True. That's very true. Yes. Um, how
00:41:28.880 does it make you feel knowing you're
00:41:30.240 living right next door to something
00:41:31.680 potentially that is the biggest secret
00:41:34.000 in human history?
00:41:36.800 I hope the truth comes out one day. Um,
00:41:39.680 all of this is hidden right under our
00:41:41.520 feet. And just to know that probably
00:41:44.640 everything that we suspect is true is
00:41:47.680 um, it captures my imagination. So here
00:41:50.880 we are at the end of our journey and we
00:41:54.480 find ourselves at a nondescript cement
00:41:57.359 plant owned ultimately by a major
00:42:01.520 aerospace company Loheed Martin. And
00:42:05.040 it's funny because they don't advertise
00:42:07.040 their presence. You just have to read it
00:42:08.880 in the sign. And there is a lot of
00:42:11.880 security. Is it plausible this is some
00:42:15.359 kind of entry point for an underground
00:42:17.359 facility? I just don't know. But I have
00:42:20.960 to say after this journey, it's not so
00:42:24.319 easily
00:42:27.000 dismissed. And before we go, please
