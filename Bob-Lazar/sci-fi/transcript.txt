00:00:00.560 guys but the search for proof of
00:00:02.800 extraterrestrial intelligence has
00:00:04.680 produced disappointing results the best
00:00:07.439 so-called evidence has only been a few
00:00:09.200 photographs and film clips but now all
00:00:12.400 that's about to
00:00:14.519 change since 1985 more than 15 million
00:00:17.920 Americans have reportedly witnessed
00:00:19.760 unidentified flying objects but despite
00:00:22.680 the seemingly overwhelming evidence
00:00:24.640 mainstream science has chosen to ignore
00:00:26.720 the subject but now for the first time
00:00:29.279 in history one of the greatest mysteries
00:00:31.279 of this century is unraveling a former
00:00:33.879 government scientist has come forward to
00:00:36.040 discuss the military's classified work
00:00:38.239 on extraterrestrial

00:00:54.440 spacecraft the end of World War II and
00:00:56.680 the invention of the atomic bomb
00:00:58.359 signaled a new era of inter National
00:01:00.640 mistrust since the earliest days of the
00:01:02.840 Cold War which coincides with the
00:01:04.599 Roswell incident and the start of the
00:01:06.200 modern UFO era the military has been
00:01:08.960 especially secretive about its advances
00:01:10.759 and achievements while always searching
00:01:12.759 for the Perfect Weapon or super
00:01:14.720 sophisticated tool of
00:01:18.570 [Music]
00:01:20.920 Espionage high-tech surveillance
00:01:22.880 equipment around the world and even in
00:01:24.759 space has allowed Global intelligence to
00:01:27.159 see and be aware of many things that the
00:01:29.439 comment of civilian cannot even begin to
00:01:33.759 imagine the military recruits many
00:01:36.119 talented civilians when special
00:01:37.880 expertise is required and propulsion
00:01:40.520 systems expert Bob Lazar claims he was
00:01:43.159 one of
00:01:45.000 them in this exclusive interview he
00:01:47.479 gives his detailed account of his
00:01:49.000 employment with the Department of Naval
00:01:50.600 intelligence at the top secret facility
00:01:52.840 known as S4 where according to Bob he
00:01:56.119 was hired to work on recovered alien
00:01:58.119 spacecraft
00:02:00.000 this now not so secret military base at
00:02:02.200 Groom Lake Nevada is known as Area 51 or
00:02:05.479 Dreamland as insiders like to call
00:02:08.360 it born in 1959 in Coral Gables Florida
00:02:12.440 Bob has lived much of his life in Las
00:02:14.200 Vegas
00:02:16.319 Nevada with degrees in physics and
00:02:18.560 electronics from MIT and Caltech he has
00:02:21.319 dabbled in everything from chemistry to
00:02:23.360 fireworks in an effort to understand the
00:02:25.480 finer points of
00:02:26.720 propulsion he has even assembled a jet
00:02:29.120 car with 22,000 horsepower engine
00:02:31.879 salvaged from a Navy f3d Sky Knight that
00:02:34.760 is capable of land speeds of over 350 M
00:02:39.760 hour fate took a serious turn for Bob in
00:02:43.280 1982 arriving early for a lecture at Los
00:02:46.000 Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
00:02:48.120 given by Dr Edward Teller one of the
00:02:50.360 inventors of the atomic bomb Bob was
00:02:52.840 able to meet and talk to the famous
00:02:55.400 physicist coincidentally Dr Teller was
00:02:57.840 reading the local paper the monitor with
00:03:00.000 a featured front page article on Bob and
00:03:02.319 the two struck up a conversation later
00:03:05.000 Bob sent Dr Teller his resume for
00:03:07.000 consideration and soon after Bob was
00:03:09.080 hired by the Los Alamos National
00:03:10.879 Laboratory this Los Alamos Bas directory
00:03:13.480 lists Bob as an
00:03:16.400 employee by 1989 Bob was brought into
00:03:19.840 the top secret program at S4 known as
00:03:22.720 project Galileo in the following
00:03:25.200 interview Bob reveals many details of
00:03:27.879 this amazing experience
00:03:36.319 did you witness any disc technology at
00:03:38.640 Area 51 no there was no absolutely no ET
00:03:43.200 craft ET technology anything like that
00:03:45.280 at Area 51 this is why S4 was made
00:03:47.879 specifically to separate it there people
00:03:49.760 at Area 51 do not have the
00:03:51.920 clearance how long were you employed at
00:03:54.319 S4 and when were you
00:03:58.280 hired when was I hired at us for I guess
00:04:01.480 early '89 and I was probably there only
00:04:04.720 about 6 months or
00:04:07.280 so uh on a very infrequent basis how
00:04:11.040 were you transported to and from
00:04:14.079 work at the time that I was working
00:04:16.560 there at McCaron international airport
00:04:19.000 in Las Vegas there was a special
00:04:20.880 projects eg&g
00:04:23.440 building when I was told to go to work I
00:04:26.360 drove there parked my car there uh and
00:04:31.080 got in a plane at the airport flew to
00:04:33.919 groom Lake where I deplaned and waited
00:04:36.919 for a bus and the bus drove me down to
00:04:40.320 uh S4 the S4 facility is an area just
00:04:46.440 off the papoose lake bed dry like bed
00:04:50.360 and it consists of nine hangers the
00:04:53.880 hangers have uh slope doors on them with
00:04:56.400 a sand texture coating around the
00:04:59.240 opposite end of the hangers there's the
00:05:02.639 standard entrance where you're dropped
00:05:04.240 off at go through a security check and
00:05:07.280 inside there's a small
00:05:09.800 complex uh there is some office space
00:05:12.639 there's several Laboratories the hangers
00:05:14.720 themselves of course and uh a few other
00:05:18.560 places I didn't have free rain to go
00:05:20.759 wherever I wanted to everywhere I went
00:05:23.000 to I was essentially escorted so uh that
00:05:26.039 was really all about that uh I saw
00:05:30.319 inside the facility what was the basic
00:05:33.120 layout were there underground
00:05:36.120 levels I don't think there were any
00:05:37.960 underground levels to it though there
00:05:39.360 there could have been I don't think it
00:05:41.319 was a you know an extensive underground
00:05:43.800 facility it just looked like uh an
00:05:46.800 installation that was butt up against a
00:05:49.160 mountain and uh you know I didn't see
00:05:52.560 any evidence of any stairs going down
00:05:55.000 elevators or uh but like I said I don't
00:05:59.360 know there could have been and I just
00:06:00.960 might not have been permitted in those
00:06:02.960 areas it's difficult to uh to really
00:06:06.319 surmise how long it had been operational
00:06:08.280 everything did look fairly new uh by
00:06:11.880 that I mean I don't think this
00:06:13.560 installation was there in the early
00:06:16.120 70s uh nothing was worn uh things look
00:06:20.479 fairly freshly painted so uh you know as
00:06:24.880 a ballpark guess I would say it would it
00:06:28.039 would really surprise me if the station
00:06:30.080 was older
00:06:31.440 than 5 7 10 years something like
00:06:35.840 that killed in the project what exactly
00:06:38.560 happened
00:06:39.759 there allegedly obviously I didn't see
00:06:42.800 this and I don't know it to be fact but
00:06:44.280 this is what I was told that I was hired
00:06:46.840 uh to replace one of a couple people
00:06:50.120 that were killed uh while working on one
00:06:52.599 of the reactors from one of the crafts
00:06:54.639 apparently they for whatever reason cut
00:06:57.240 open an operating reactor and the device
00:07:00.960 exploded killing both of them the
00:07:03.599 scientists that were killed there uh
00:07:05.639 allegedly the detonation from the
00:07:07.680 explosion was fairly large uh it would
00:07:10.800 have rivaled a small tactical nuke so it
00:07:13.960 was done at the Nevada test site and it
00:07:16.000 was to be passed off as an un
00:07:17.680 unannounced nuclear nuclear test did you
00:07:21.039 have any direct contact or communication
00:07:23.160 with aliens no not at
00:07:25.319 all tell us about the briefing files
00:07:27.960 under what conditions did did you gain
00:07:30.039 access to them I was put into the
00:07:32.479 briefing room with 121 or 22 briefings
00:07:37.280 and really was just told to sit and read
00:07:40.120 through
00:07:41.400 them I think they were there just to
00:07:43.479 mainly educate me on on what was going
00:07:45.960 on they weren't a complete in indepth
00:07:49.159 explanation on everything else but just
00:07:51.599 uh essentially a brief synopsis on some
00:07:54.159 of the other projects that were going on
00:07:56.120 there supposedly the information now
00:07:58.479 this isn't something that I termin it's
00:07:59.960 something I was told that uh the crafts
00:08:02.120 originated from uh a planet that orbited
00:08:07.319 The Zeta reticul star system Zeta
00:08:09.759 reticul 1 and Zeta reticul 2 are two two
00:08:12.360 stars of a binary star system uh the
00:08:15.479 craft allegedly came from there one or
00:08:18.360 two autopsy photographs I saw uh dealt
00:08:21.680 with just a small photograph a bus shot
00:08:24.960 essentially just head shoulders and
00:08:26.479 chest of an alien with a uh uh ch was
00:08:29.800 cut open in t fashion and one single
00:08:31.720 organ was
00:08:33.159 removed uh the organ itself and in the
00:08:36.760 other picture was uh cut in Viva section
00:08:40.399 essentially the uh showing the different
00:08:43.360 chambers in there this was totally
00:08:46.200 unrelated to anything I was doing but
00:08:49.080 from that photograph it looked like what
00:08:51.720 you see in UFO lore as the typical gray
00:08:54.600 so how tall it was from what I could see
00:08:56.839 I I couldn't tell cuz I only saw a
00:08:59.000 portion of the the photograph but if
00:09:01.040 everything else you see is correct I
00:09:03.760 would imagine it was 3 and 1/2 or 4T
00:09:07.000 tall but uh there again you know all I
00:09:09.600 had to see was a photograph
00:09:12.279 and you know I didn't have much to go on
00:09:15.040 what was the incident in
00:09:16.560 1979 that brought the alien Exchange
00:09:19.160 program of information to a halt again
00:09:22.040 this was a story that was related to me
00:09:24.360 and uh allegedly what happened in 79
00:09:27.839 there was some sort of information
00:09:29.720 exchange going on where there were
00:09:31.120 actual live aliens at the facility and
00:09:34.800 at one particular point there was an
00:09:38.440 area where some security Personnel went
00:09:41.320 to enter and apparently because of not
00:09:44.839 the sidearms but the bullets in the
00:09:46.600 sidearms from what I understand if they
00:09:49.399 would have entered the area the
00:09:51.320 bullets would have
00:09:54.120 detonated uh and supposedly one of the
00:09:58.160 creatures tried to stop
00:10:00.160 stop the security Personnel from
00:10:02.440 entering the area and a fight ensued and
00:10:05.320 the bottom line from the altercation was
00:10:08.440 that the uh security Personnel I don't
00:10:11.920 remember how many were involved but were
00:10:14.040 all killed and they died of head wounds
00:10:15.720 and that's all that all that I heard of
00:10:18.200 that story what was your job description
00:10:20.440 at
00:10:21.800 S4 my official job description was a
00:10:24.920 senior staff
00:10:26.320 physicist uh I don't know if I
00:10:31.519 actually had that position when I was
00:10:33.240 there because I was there so
00:10:34.320 infrequently I wasn't supervising anyone
00:10:36.920 so I uh that that was the official
00:10:38.920 position I was hired under but uh
00:10:40.880 whether or not I actually acted in that
00:10:42.760 capacity I don't
00:10:45.399 know what was the size of the staff
00:10:48.040 working on Project
00:10:49.800 Galileo well there were 22 people
00:10:51.959 employed there totally and that was
00:10:54.440 specifically for the Galileo project no
00:10:57.160 for the entire project oh I see there
00:10:59.120 were 22 people with Majestic clearance I
00:11:01.959 had Majestic clearance Majestic
00:11:03.600 clearance was designated as a clearance
00:11:06.839 38 levels above Q clearance and Q
00:11:09.279 clearance is the civilian uh top secret
00:11:13.399 clearance when did you see your first
00:11:16.560 disc the first disc I saw I believe it
00:11:19.800 was the second or I think it was the
00:11:22.240 third time I was up there uh normally
00:11:24.600 the bus pulled around to the opposite
00:11:26.320 end of the facility which was the main
00:11:28.440 entrance and that's where we went in on
00:11:31.800 um this particular occasion it pulled up
00:11:33.920 to one of the hanger doors which were
00:11:35.839 normally closed and the last one was
00:11:37.920 open we came out and I saw the disc in
00:11:40.880 the hanger uh upon seeing it it it
00:11:44.120 struck me that well this explains all
00:11:47.120 the UFO sightings not thinking that it
00:11:49.240 was an extraterrestrial craft that this
00:11:51.000 must have been some advanced form of
00:11:53.279 fighter that we've been working on for
00:11:54.839 years and you know people have just
00:11:56.279 caught it being tested so on and so
00:11:58.160 forth and uh it never even occurred to
00:12:01.240 me even though I was looking at an
00:12:02.480 extraterrestrial vehicle that you know
00:12:04.639 this wasn't
00:12:06.200 man-made when did you realize the craft
00:12:08.600 was not of Earthly
00:12:12.000 origin
00:12:14.560 well it probably really hit
00:12:17.720 me when I got inside the
00:12:20.519 craft and looked around and began to
00:12:24.519 understand how the craft was operated
00:12:26.720 and finally grasp the whole project as a
00:12:30.320 whole as what we were doing the fact
00:12:33.000 that we weren't building this thing we
00:12:35.079 were trying to find out how it was made
00:12:37.160 we were back engineering
00:12:40.519 it what is back
00:12:43.240 engineering well back engineering is
00:12:45.560 taking a finished
00:12:47.360 product and finding out how the device
00:12:52.000 or product was
00:12:54.399 produced and essentially determining
00:12:58.600 whether or not you can duplicate
00:13:01.760 it now scientists aside what was your
00:13:05.000 emotional response what were you
00:13:06.320 thinking were the implications to the
00:13:09.600 world or man in general from these
00:13:13.040 Revelations I really didn't think about
00:13:15.440 implications of that sort as far as
00:13:19.279 emotionally uh people have asserted that
00:13:22.399 boy that must have been the most
00:13:23.519 exciting time in your life and that's
00:13:25.959 not the way it was when I first got to
00:13:28.399 look inside the craft the all I can say
00:13:31.040 it's an ominous feeling you walk in
00:13:33.079 there and uh it's it feels as if you
00:13:37.199 shouldn't be there I know that sounds
00:13:38.440 kind of corny but it's a real ominous
00:13:41.199 feeling it's not an exciting feeling uh
00:13:44.320 it brings up a whole lot of questions in
00:13:45.839 your mind well where did this come from
00:13:47.519 and you know that they won't give you
00:13:48.959 the answers to the whole story but it's
00:13:51.160 uh that's the only way I can describe it
00:13:54.279 let's go people've
00:13:56.279 lift it produces a gravity wave
00:13:59.560 which is similar to the gravity wave
00:14:02.800 that the Earth
00:14:04.440 produces however the craft phase shifts
00:14:07.399 The
00:14:08.079 Wave in other words it it turns the
00:14:11.959 wave not really in an opposite polarity
00:14:14.720 but something to that effect where it
00:14:17.360 will work against the natural gravity
00:14:19.920 wave of the earth and it produces lift
00:14:21.680 in in that effect is there any internal
00:14:24.639 protection for the crew does the craft
00:14:27.079 generate a a gravitational field inside
00:14:30.320 the craft itself well the craft
00:14:33.560 generates its own gravitational field
00:14:36.040 being inside that
00:14:38.440 field
00:14:42.600 essentially doesn't Shield you but
00:14:45.199 essentially you're in and this is a
00:14:48.199 terrible way to say it almost in a
00:14:49.560 different realm because you're you're
00:14:51.880 now influenced only that by that
00:14:53.440 gravitational field for instance people
00:14:55.800 wonder how a craft like this can make a
00:14:59.279 turn at such high speed a 90 degree turn
00:15:02.680 when they would imagine people slamming
00:15:04.560 up against the wall or something to that
00:15:06.240 effect well that that really wouldn't
00:15:07.720 happen inertia would have no effect uh
00:15:10.040 you're you're in a distortion and don't
00:15:13.720 forget that gravity distorts time and
00:15:15.959 space so really nothing is going to
00:15:17.800 influence you while you're in there
00:15:20.040 describe the gravity amplifiers for us
00:15:22.560 and some of their different operating
00:15:24.880 configurations there are three
00:15:26.440 amplifiers
00:15:29.079 the craft can operate on a single one
00:15:32.199 can lift off the
00:15:33.560 ground the way in which it's
00:15:38.240 propelled are two different ways there's
00:15:41.079 what they call Omron configuration where
00:15:43.959 the craft is using one
00:15:46.600 generator uh or Delta configuration
00:15:49.040 where it's us utilizing all three Delta
00:15:51.800 configuration would be for space travel
00:15:54.079 essentially the craft will tilt up on
00:15:55.600 its
00:15:56.480 side as opposed to a science fiction
00:15:58.680 move where you see a flying saucer
00:16:00.319 moving around the graft will tilt up on
00:16:02.399 its side Focus the three gravity
00:16:04.680 generators to a single point and move
00:16:06.600 through space that way moving around the
00:16:09.279 source of gravity is a problem to a disc
00:16:12.040 because it's interference essentially so
00:16:15.519 what they do is they work with that
00:16:17.040 interference to their benefit they'll
00:16:19.079 use one gravity generator to lift the
00:16:21.880 craft off the
00:16:23.319 ground and as opposed to what we're used
00:16:25.759 to for instance a plane once it's in the
00:16:28.079 air we envision
00:16:29.839 thrust or some Force coming out the back
00:16:32.319 of it to push it forward the crafts work
00:16:35.480 completely opposite of that what they do
00:16:39.519 is once they're hovering in the air
00:16:41.240 they'll swing the gravity two remaining
00:16:43.639 gravity generators up in front of them
00:16:45.880 and create a distortion essentially a
00:16:49.199 downhill and the craft rolls downhill
00:16:53.440 for Infinity it's always chasing a
00:16:55.399 little Distortion that's why they look
00:16:58.319 Goofy when they fly around at low speed
00:17:00.880 because they're essentially and anytime
00:17:02.720 you run over you know the gravity field
00:17:05.480 around the earth is not completely
00:17:07.000 constant and stable depending on the
00:17:08.919 minerals and density of the earth
00:17:10.439 underneath it the gravity will vary
00:17:14.480 somewhat and you will get odd movements
00:17:16.799 of The Craft so it's low speed mode is
00:17:20.240 is kind of unstable for the most part I
00:17:23.039 only witnessed one test flight up close
00:17:26.400 officially uh that I was in just inside
00:17:29.760 the hanger uh the test was going off
00:17:32.880 probably you know uh just as the sun was
00:17:35.880 going down and it was a a low
00:17:39.440 performance test I believe there were uh
00:17:43.280 some Pilots or test pilots in the craft
00:17:45.320 the craft must have been retrofitted to
00:17:47.679 fit them because the seating
00:17:49.200 arrangements were really not
00:17:51.360 accommodating um they were in radio
00:17:54.320 communication with the craft which is
00:17:56.120 kind of surprising to me because the
00:17:57.799 gravity waves that the craft was
00:18:00.400 producing should have uh distorted the
00:18:03.039 radio waves also so apparently there's
00:18:05.840 something there that I don't understand
00:18:08.480 um the craft lifted off the ground uh
00:18:12.039 virtually noisess other than a small
00:18:13.679 Corona discharge on the bottom of the
00:18:15.360 craft indicating the presence of high
00:18:17.440 voltage uh that dissipated at about 30
00:18:20.440 ft and it stood there completely
00:18:22.080 silently and moved over to the left to
00:18:25.679 the right and sat back down that was the
00:18:27.799 entire uh
00:18:29.720 test however that was an extremely
00:18:32.120 impressive test
00:18:34.480 uh maybe to someone that really knows
00:18:36.880 little about science or anything that
00:18:38.679 that wouldn't be a whole lot but you
00:18:40.600 have to realize this craft was about 52
00:18:42.679 ft in diameter I don't know exactly how
00:18:44.880 much it weighed but it weighed a lot and
00:18:47.760 uh this was quite quite a scientific
00:18:50.480 feat to lift something completely
00:18:52.120 silently under control and uh you know
00:18:56.000 perform a maneuver like that the CRA
00:18:59.039 itself was uh I assume it was metal it
00:19:01.600 was cold to the touch that's why I say
00:19:03.240 it was metal but it was a
00:19:05.440 uh brush aluminum actually just an
00:19:08.080 unfinished stainless steel not shiny uh
00:19:11.360 finish to it had no seams it was as if
00:19:14.840 it was injection molded from one giant
00:19:17.480 diey I was completely amazed I I can't
00:19:21.600 really
00:19:24.120 reflect on how it made me feel but it
00:19:26.799 that was exciting
00:19:28.919 how would you define gravity could you
00:19:31.600 describe in layman's terms its basic
00:19:34.200 principles for
00:19:36.520 us gravity is something difficult to
00:19:38.880 explain because it's
00:19:41.280 something that we essentially don't
00:19:43.600 understand it's just something that we
00:19:44.559 can observe not much is really known
00:19:46.240 about gravity uh there are many theories
00:19:48.600 about it but they are just mainly
00:19:50.520 theories theories of gravitons which
00:19:52.919 allege that there these these subatomic
00:19:55.799 particles that that act like an
00:19:58.679 attractive Force like gravity that
00:20:00.600 exchange between two pieces of matter
00:20:02.919 there's also a theory that gravity is a
00:20:05.600 form of wave and electromagnetic wave uh
00:20:08.720 but basically gravity is a force it's
00:20:13.480 uh it's it's the attraction it well it's
00:20:16.480 the inherent property of matter to have
00:20:19.320 gravity a mutual attraction for each
00:20:21.039 other and that's it it's basically all
00:20:23.480 that we really
00:20:24.760 know modern science current science
00:20:28.120 right now identifies one gravity it's
00:20:30.480 one force in nature uh
00:20:33.720 apparently through research it as for or
00:20:36.360 information gained from one of the
00:20:38.600 crafts they were researching there uh it
00:20:41.799 appears that there are two different
00:20:42.919 forms of gravity one form works on an
00:20:46.799 atomic scale on subatomic particles
00:20:49.840 holding pieces of matter holding atoms
00:20:52.440 themselves together another works on a
00:20:55.240 larger scale the scale we're most most
00:20:57.600 familiar with uh
00:20:59.600 holding planets in orbit holding
00:21:01.760 ourselves to the ground things of that
00:21:03.760 sort because it produces a gravitational
00:21:06.360 field it I I wouldn't say the craft is
00:21:08.360 invisible during the day however if
00:21:10.159 you're under the
00:21:12.080 craft because of the way the gravity is
00:21:15.360 being used gravity bends time and space
00:21:18.440 and it bends light if you are looking
00:21:20.960 underneath the craft or from certain
00:21:22.919 Vantage points you will actually see
00:21:25.440 what's above the craft it's a it's
00:21:27.960 really a trick of the way light bends
00:21:31.400 under the influence of
00:21:32.960 gravity for instance we can see stars
00:21:35.760 that are behind the Sun that are blocked
00:21:38.640 from our view by the Sun the reason we
00:21:40.240 can see them is because the sun is a
00:21:42.279 tremendous gravitational field and it's
00:21:44.039 bending the light around it where we can
00:21:46.600 see the star SpaceTime and gravity are
00:21:49.600 all essentially
00:21:51.360 interrelated they all act on one
00:21:54.240 another gravity bends space
00:21:58.760 gravity also distorts time when you vary
00:22:01.600 one you essentially vary the other
00:22:03.799 two uh if
00:22:06.679 you as an example if you have a massive
00:22:09.480 body say a planet or or something that's
00:22:11.600 making a lot of gravity producing a lot
00:22:13.640 of gravitational waves if you will um it
00:22:17.559 distorts space it bends space to it it
00:22:20.919 also slows down time these things aren't
00:22:24.200 theories we know them to be true uh we
00:22:26.960 cannot artificially create them this
00:22:29.000 because we can't create gravity uh but
00:22:33.600 this is how they're all
00:22:35.080 interrelated his with traveling at the
00:22:37.919 speed of light there are several
00:22:40.320 problems traveling at the speed of light
00:22:42.520 uh just a couple of them are the fact
00:22:45.640 that as your speed increases so does
00:22:47.720 your mass
00:22:48.960 proportionally uh in other words the
00:22:51.559 more energy you put in to go
00:22:54.240 faster begins to slow you down by the
00:22:56.880 fact that it's converted into
00:22:59.799 Mass um you have other problems like
00:23:02.400 just traveling at such an Extreme
00:23:05.320 Velocity navigational problems the fact
00:23:08.360 that you might run into little tiny
00:23:10.400 microm
00:23:11.360 meteorites uh at at speeds like this
00:23:14.000 they would undoubtedly destroy your
00:23:15.720 craft there's just a a whole host of
00:23:18.559 problems that you're going to run into
00:23:20.640 uh just attempting to do something like
00:23:22.279 that aside from the fact the amount of
00:23:24.279 energy required to accelerate to the
00:23:26.000 speed of light is horrendous
00:23:29.279 could you briefly describe project
00:23:31.000 Looking Glass and project sidekick for
00:23:32.960 us project sidekick was another project
00:23:35.520 going on uh with Galileo Galileo was the
00:23:38.640 project that I was involved in sidekick
00:23:40.720 dealt with any of the weapon potential
00:23:42.919 of The Craft whether or not the craft
00:23:44.960 had a weapon in it or could it be used
00:23:48.760 as a weapon but it had something to do
00:23:50.480 with some sort of particle
00:23:52.080 beam uh configuration where the gravity
00:23:55.240 generator can be used as a lens to focus
00:23:58.159 focus us a weapon of some sort similar
00:24:00.000 to the SDI device we were working on in
00:24:03.080 the uh the80s but with a potential of a
00:24:06.400 focusing device using the uh gravity
00:24:10.240 generator and project Looking Glass
00:24:13.320 Project Looking Glass dealt with the
00:24:15.000 Distortion the fact that there's a Time
00:24:17.240 Distortion essentially looking back in
00:24:19.640 time and by that I do not mean looking
00:24:22.159 back years ago to see the Wagon Train
00:24:24.640 days they're looking for distortions
00:24:26.159 that are milliseconds in time and what
00:24:28.399 what that was used for I I don't know
00:24:30.200 but that was uh just observing the time
00:24:33.120 the the time Distortion time dilation
00:24:35.640 phenomena the craft and operation what
00:24:38.200 is element 115 is it found here on Earth
00:24:41.320 or is it strictly an extraterrestrial
00:24:43.440 material 115 is strictly an
00:24:45.840 extraterrestrial material U it probably
00:24:49.360 occurs naturally in some other places
00:24:53.159 maybe other star
00:24:54.679 systems uh you some people not familiar
00:24:57.640 with science or chem say well that's
00:24:59.080 ridiculous all the elements occur on
00:25:00.640 Earth you know uh but that's not true
00:25:03.320 there are elements on the periodic chart
00:25:04.960 that aren't found on Earth I believe the
00:25:07.320 heavy ion research lab in darot Germany
00:25:10.520 uh has reached element 112 recently so
00:25:14.679 115 isn't isn't that far away and when
00:25:17.679 they synthesize it it's not like they're
00:25:19.200 making a couple ounces of it they're
00:25:21.279 talking about one or two atoms of it to
00:25:23.520 make any usable quantity of a heavy
00:25:25.440 ailment like that is virtually
00:25:27.320 impossible Element
00:25:29.640 115 is in the top of the reactor and the
00:25:33.720 base of the reactor apparently is a
00:25:37.320 small something similar to a cyclotron
00:25:40.240 it's a particle
00:25:41.679 accelerator uh a particle is accelerated
00:25:45.799 to high speed and then deflected up a
00:25:48.559 small tube and it's aimed at the5 this
00:25:53.240 transmutes the
00:25:54.720 115 uh similar to the way we we do that
00:25:58.279 in a normal particle accelerator uh this
00:26:01.960 causes a reaction a radiation emission
00:26:05.360 that we really haven't seen before um it
00:26:08.640 produces anim matter this Annie matter
00:26:12.240 is guided down a tuned tube and
00:26:15.360 reacts with a
00:26:17.799 gas when matter and Ann matter react
00:26:20.760 they convert to 100%
00:26:24.039 energy this energy is converted Heat
00:26:28.320 energy is converted to electrical power
00:26:30.840 in the reactor itself this is done
00:26:32.679 through
00:26:33.840 a a thermoelectric
00:26:36.559 converter and this electrical power is
00:26:38.880 used to power other subsystems on the
00:26:41.000 craft though there is no wiring you know
00:26:43.279 as we would know it uh also that's
00:26:46.919 almost a byproduct of the reactor the
00:26:48.520 reactor also sets up a gravitational
00:26:51.240 wave from the 115 being bombarded this
00:26:54.679 gravitational wave was present at the
00:26:56.559 top of the reactor and is a essentially
00:26:58.760 guided in the same way microwaves are
00:27:00.559 guided through tuned tubes and uh this
00:27:04.120 goes to their amplifying cavities and
00:27:06.240 through the projectors that are in the
00:27:07.559 bottom of the craft with the gravity
00:27:09.679 generators running is there thermal
00:27:11.799 radiation danger to the
00:27:13.840 crew there is no thermal radiation while
00:27:16.440 the reactor is
00:27:17.480 running the thermionic generator is 100%
00:27:20.679 efficient which is in violation of the
00:27:22.799 first law of
00:27:23.960 thermodynamics but in fact it works
00:27:28.640 Element 115 is
00:27:30.559 stable and for those familiar with
00:27:33.520 chemistry we know that uh elements with
00:27:37.039 higher atomic numbers have shorter and
00:27:38.799 shorter
00:27:41.039 half-lies um however when you reach a
00:27:44.720 certain point they call it the island of
00:27:46.960 stability there is a place and we've
00:27:50.200 theorized this for a long time somewhere
00:27:52.360 around 114 to 116 there should be an
00:27:55.720 area in there where the nucleus of the
00:27:59.279 atom is geometrically stable with
00:28:01.600 protons and neutrons where it it no
00:28:04.039 longer decays it's not radioactive 115
00:28:06.880 is in fact this element in fact it does
00:28:09.399 occur again somewhere around element
00:28:13.000 247 uh of course you we're nowhere near
00:28:15.960 synthesizing that we can only you know
00:28:18.480 predict things like that but uh that's
00:28:21.559 that's where 115 is did they the aliens
00:28:24.840 give us Element 115 in large quantities
00:28:27.399 whether or not it was was given to us I
00:28:30.320 I I can't answer that question however I
00:28:33.200 was told that we have 500 lb by one of
00:28:38.159 my
00:28:38.880 co-workers uh how it was obtained and
00:28:41.600 you know where exactly it came from I
00:28:43.159 don't know whether it came in one of the
00:28:44.559 crafts
00:28:45.760 or you know it was separate cargo
00:28:48.039 somewhere anyone can speculate but I was
00:28:50.399 I was told that was the the
00:28:52.200 figure you were able to get away with a
00:28:54.640 sample of element 115 how much did you
00:28:57.279 get away with
00:28:59.080 comment the several nighttime test
00:29:01.960 flights unofficially while off the base
00:29:05.480 what did you
00:29:07.760 see the test flights I saw off the base
00:29:10.480 actually the the best test flight was
00:29:12.200 witnessed by my friends who I had
00:29:13.960 brought out there at the uh exact moment
00:29:17.279 the craft was hopping around to doing
00:29:19.440 some really impressive Maneuvers I had
00:29:21.200 turned around and I think was uh looking
00:29:24.080 for the video camera or something to
00:29:26.000 that effect but I missed some of the
00:29:27.720 most uh impressive Maneuvers but the
00:29:30.519 craft was uh similar to what was done
00:29:32.840 before that I had seen close up other
00:29:34.679 than the fact that it went above the
00:29:36.440 mountain range uh moved a a much greater
00:29:40.080 distance at a much higher rate of
00:29:43.600 speed how were you able to find out
00:29:46.200 about the test flight
00:29:48.720 schedules the test flight schedules were
00:29:50.880 told to me uh specifically because I was
00:29:54.440 probably going to have to be present
00:29:56.159 during those times and at that time the
00:29:59.279 test flights were taking place on
00:30:00.880 Wednesday nights and from what they said
00:30:03.880 that was because that was uh
00:30:06.440 statistically the least amount of
00:30:07.919 traffic in the area and that's all that
00:30:10.240 they were concerned
00:30:12.519 about does the propulsion system release
00:30:15.399 any sort of discharge or exhaust there
00:30:18.080 was a high voltage discharge on the
00:30:19.720 bottom of the craft but uh as far as
00:30:21.519 there being an exhaust there was
00:30:23.760 none why did they appear as glowing
00:30:26.440 balls of light in the night
00:30:29.200 Sky well that's kind of the same reason
00:30:31.799 why a neon light or a fluorescent light
00:30:33.880 lights up what you're dealing with with
00:30:36.640 as a high energy source in essentially a
00:30:40.440 gas atmosphere oxygen nitrogen and uh
00:30:44.519 when you apply enough energy to a gas
00:30:47.679 molecule they emit photons they emit
00:30:50.480 light and uh I don't think it's anything
00:30:53.440 it's a really a byproduct of how the
00:30:55.000 craft operates when it's emitting that
00:30:56.840 much energy the gas surrounding the
00:30:59.679 craft emits light the same reason why
00:31:02.080 lightning is visible you have a huge
00:31:04.039 electrical
00:31:05.440 discharge and the gas emits light in the
00:31:07.760 form of lightning bolb if you were going
00:31:10.200 to see one of these crafts at night
00:31:11.840 operating it would appear really as a
00:31:14.440 glowing ball or a just a bright light in
00:31:17.360 the sky from a distance uh even close up
00:31:21.039 you'd see a glowing halo around it uh
00:31:24.639 this is typically what you'd see in your
00:31:26.399 normal UFO sighting uh if you've heard
00:31:29.039 them a lot however keep in mind that
00:31:32.200 lights in the sky are caused by much
00:31:33.840 more common things than flying
00:31:35.880 saucers tell us a little more about the
00:31:38.000 Aurora you witnessed taking off out of
00:31:39.960 Area 51 it was a large craft and the one
00:31:44.440 Glimpse I got of it was from the rear
00:31:47.600 and it had two huge Square exhaust with
00:31:51.880 veins in them and uh it was just it
00:31:55.519 sounded more like a rocket than a jet I
00:31:58.200 don't know i' even think he did mention
00:32:01.039 that it was Liquid methane powered but
00:32:03.960 um there again you know working on the
00:32:07.279 disc technology I really could care less
00:32:09.799 what was rolling around at Area 51 but
00:32:12.519 it it did catch my eye as a result of
00:32:15.639 going public have there been any
00:32:17.159 attempts made on your life one day when
00:32:19.960 I was getting on um Interstate
00:32:23.399 15 driving down Charleston Boulevard uh
00:32:26.919 a car came up alongside of me and uh I
00:32:30.240 thought he was just trying to race me to
00:32:31.559 get on the freeway uh this was after I
00:32:34.519 had left the
00:32:36.120 project um it was a white boxy looking
00:32:40.360 car exactly what making model I don't
00:32:42.519 know but um I accelerated to get on the
00:32:46.559 freeway to go fast and there was a
00:32:49.240 gunshot and the back of the car was hit
00:32:52.679 and I sked off into the uh median and I
00:32:57.519 stopped stopped and I was frightened and
00:33:00.000 I just stood there because I thought the
00:33:01.519 guy was going to be alongside of me and
00:33:03.159 just shoot me I had nothing to do I was
00:33:04.840 essentially paralyzed with with fear and
00:33:07.240 I waited there and then nothing else
00:33:09.679 happened and do I know it was a
00:33:12.279 government agent trying to kill me no it
00:33:14.279 could have been a driveby shooting maybe
00:33:18.480 uh you know
00:33:21.120 so wasn't I mean it was an attempt on my
00:33:23.720 life but by who specifically I don't
00:33:25.519 know though I was threatened uh before I
00:33:28.919 had left that they threatened my wife's
00:33:30.760 life and my life so I can only put two
00:33:32.960 and two together and say that they were
00:33:34.799 kind of pissed at me in an earlier
00:33:37.559 interview you had mentioned that they
00:33:39.120 had put a gun to your head tell us about
00:33:40.919 that that was after we were
00:33:45.000 caught out when I had the test flight
00:33:47.399 schedule and uh I brought some friends
00:33:50.279 out to show them the disc test uh we got
00:33:54.240 caught out
00:33:55.440 there and the following day I was brief
00:33:58.159 down at Indian Springs Air Force Base
00:34:01.440 and
00:34:03.480 um I was in the room with the security
00:34:06.240 guards that caught us my supervisor and
00:34:09.159 some other people and uh some of
00:34:11.520 security
00:34:12.560 Personnel uh yeah they were essentially
00:34:16.000 grilling me about security and you know
00:34:18.560 how could I possibly bring people out
00:34:20.199 there and uh I guess I wasn't as
00:34:23.320 responsive as they would like and they
00:34:25.918 got in my face and one of them pulled it
00:34:27.879 sidearm out you know just pushed it
00:34:31.159 against
00:34:32.119 me have you maintained any contacts with
00:34:34.719 your colleagues out of S4 no I never
00:34:37.760 heard from anyone other than for a very
00:34:40.879 brief time after I left Dennis who was
00:34:44.079 my supervisor did try and make contact
00:34:46.320 with me at the uh the meeting place was
00:34:48.520 the union Plaza Hotel and I took a a
00:34:51.719 friend of mine Jee Huff down there and
00:34:53.760 another friend uh a former colleague and
00:34:56.280 scientist from Los Alamos
00:34:58.440 and we did
00:35:00.079 uh we saw him but I also did recognize
00:35:03.680 some security Personnel walking around
00:35:05.839 there from us Force whether or not it
00:35:07.320 was a setup or what was going on or he
00:35:09.680 was trying to talk to me we never found
00:35:12.480 out and we left it just was a real
00:35:14.599 strange situation I never heard from him
00:35:16.800 since as we enter the 21st century how
00:35:20.440 has your experience changed your beliefs
00:35:23.440 well if you want to word the question
00:35:27.960 how are my opinions changed uh I would
00:35:30.880 say
00:35:32.000 considerably before I was at S4 I was
00:35:35.720 more or less one of the uh one of the
00:35:37.920 guys that
00:35:39.480 thought you know all these government
00:35:41.560 conspiracy and UFO Buffs and things like
00:35:43.839 that were complete
00:35:45.280 lunatics um I even remember before I was
00:35:48.920 involved there a friend showed me a
00:35:50.480 little newspaper clipping it said John
00:35:53.119 leer was giving a lecture who was uh
00:35:55.560 touting that aliens from another world
00:35:58.280 came to Earth and there's 70 different
00:35:59.760 species and I remember laughing on the
00:36:01.440 phone that this guy had lost his mind
00:36:04.640 and uh I was also under the impression
00:36:07.359 that you know boy the government's all
00:36:08.640 for the people and they you know you
00:36:11.520 know they're out here to protect us and
00:36:13.040 all that you know after the experiences
00:36:15.160 I had there uh everything is completely
00:36:18.720 turned around you know the
00:36:21.079 government is doing everything but uh
00:36:25.160 looking out for us I mean the only thing
00:36:27.200 they're looking out is for themselves
00:36:29.040 you know uh obviously the ET craft do
00:36:33.119 exist something had to build them so
00:36:35.680 there must be
00:36:37.359 aliens and since there are and the craft
00:36:39.640 of there there must be some sort of
00:36:42.000 factory and an entire civilization
00:36:44.599 somewhere and if in fact that is true
00:36:46.800 and it apparently is then there must be
00:36:51.110 [Music]
00:36:52.520 others actual crafts and Technology from
00:36:55.319 another world and uh uh that's probably
00:36:59.040 the most important event in hisory he
00:37:01.839 kind of moved from science fiction into
00:37:04.640 reality in my mind and uh it really just
00:37:07.839 I guess opened my eyes let's go whether
00:37:10.280 or not we can duplicate them I if we can
00:37:14.880 understand what a device is or how
00:37:17.520 something operates or what its physical
00:37:19.880 makeup is that's great but if we can't
00:37:22.000 duplicate it it's useless to us so
00:37:25.800 there's really two phases to the project
00:37:28.240 going on there it's understanding what
00:37:29.680 we're looking at and then once we
00:37:31.319 understand it is can we duplicate it
00:37:33.920 with Earthly materials and Earthly
00:37:35.280 technology and you know unless we've got
00:37:37.040 a handle on both of them all that
00:37:39.000 technology is useless to us and if it
00:37:42.480 turns out we can't do that all we have
00:37:44.200 is one single prized possession that we
00:37:47.440 have to take care of
00:37:48.960 and that's it after all that's been said
00:37:52.400 and done would you do this over again
00:37:54.920 what would you do differently I would
00:37:57.160 probably
00:37:58.200 have played along for a longer time um I
00:38:03.839 would like to have known a little bit
00:38:05.920 more about the technology and uh
00:38:08.680 probably kept quiet if I could
00:38:11.440 have um and possibly never have said
00:38:15.079 anything
00:38:17.359 uh I almost wish I had done that you
00:38:19.880 know it's uh it's really only caused
00:38:23.839 headaches and problems but um I believe
00:38:27.079 if I was given the opportunity again to
00:38:28.880 go back in time and redo it I think I
00:38:31.160 pretty much would have just shut up and
00:38:33.079 gone along with the program I would have
00:38:35.319 much preferred that instead of the Navy
00:38:39.640 or whoever it was uh that hand picked a
00:38:42.119 few Renegade scientists here and there
00:38:45.359 that they turn it
00:38:46.800 over to some more qualified people
00:38:49.480 obviously I was not the most qualified
00:38:51.119 person on a propulsion or field
00:38:52.599 propulsor or anything of that sort I was
00:38:54.520 just some guy I mean they could have
00:38:56.160 picked I could have named 10 or 12 other
00:38:58.160 guys that were more qualified than me
00:39:00.440 but
00:39:01.800 um you know if they turned it over to
00:39:04.000 the scientific community and not just a
00:39:05.760 couple guys here in the United States I
00:39:08.760 mean you need a large group of people in
00:39:10.920 a large lab to research what's going on
00:39:13.240 there uh not a little quiet installation
00:39:15.640 it's the it's the security
00:39:18.800 itself that prevents them from getting
00:39:21.599 anywhere I mean it they never do work
00:39:23.960 hand inand you can't have a military
00:39:26.359 mind
00:39:28.920 science itself must communicate you have
00:39:32.520 to have a free exchange of ideas that's
00:39:35.520 how things progress and when you clamp
00:39:37.960 down on a security system like that
00:39:41.240 where you
00:39:42.760 work in isolated groups and ideas cannot
00:39:46.319 be exchanged you don't get anywhere and
00:39:48.240 that's that's the problem they have what
00:39:50.520 does the future hold for Bob Lazar well
00:39:52.920 I'm not really involved in any of that
00:39:54.560 stuff anymore that's kind of put behind
00:39:56.200 me um
00:39:57.839 I have my own businesses that I work at
00:40:00.359 uh some computer Graphics uh some
00:40:04.240 consultation um other technical jobs
00:40:07.800 radiation detectors and a few other
00:40:10.200 things like that um so really I just go
00:40:13.400 about my life and that's you know
00:40:15.200 something that happened that was
00:40:16.359 fantastic and and it's over but uh it's
00:40:19.040 kind of hard to shake it loose but
00:40:21.599 eventually I will and that'll be that I
00:40:24.640 think all the surveillance and
00:40:26.280 everything stopped I don't think
00:40:27.839 anyone's bothering to monitor me i' I've
00:40:29.760 said everything that I know it's been
00:40:31.920 all over the place so it's kind of a a
00:40:35.079 done de as far as whether or not there
00:40:37.160 were any craft out there I believe you
00:40:39.800 know they were out and gone in probably
00:40:43.280 the late ' 89 early 90 and the only
00:40:46.359 thing people see now out there are you
00:40:48.000 know flares or planes coming into land
00:40:51.000 but uh that's about it did you have an
00:40:54.760 interest in flying saucers or science
00:40:56.800 fiction in General as a
00:40:58.520 child I was never interested in flying
00:41:00.800 saucers as a child science fiction you
00:41:03.119 know I watch Star Trek I guess with
00:41:05.160 everyone else back then but uh for the
00:41:08.160 most part you I didn't even believe in
00:41:10.200 flying saucers up until I was employed
00:41:12.040 at
00:41:21.880 S4 I couldn't help at one point in my
00:41:25.240 discussions with privately with
00:41:27.960 General Secretary
00:41:29.640 gorbachov when you stop to think that
00:41:32.400 we're all God's children wherever we may
00:41:34.200 live in the world I couldn't help but
00:41:36.640 say to him just think how easy his task
00:41:40.000 and mine might be in these meetings that
00:41:41.920 we held if suddenly there was a threat
00:41:44.680 to this world from some other species
00:41:48.640 from another
00:41:50.119 planet outside in the universe we'd
00:41:53.599 forget all the little local differences
00:41:55.400 that we have between our our countries
00:41:58.200 and we would find out once and for all
00:42:00.520 that we really are all human beings here
00:42:04.040 on this Earth together well I don't
00:42:08.079 suppose we can wait for some alien race
00:42:10.640 to come down and threaten us but I think
00:42:13.200 that between us we can bring about that
00:42:17.160 realization thank you all God bless you
00:42:19.599 all
00:42:28.410 [Music]
