00:00:00.719 two one boom and we're live first of all
00:00:03.439 cheers gentlemen let's have a little
00:00:05.920 toast relax bob thank you very much for
00:00:08.480 doing this i really appreciate it i
00:00:09.760 understand
00:00:10.880 that you've told this story many many
00:00:13.280 times you've been grilled many many
00:00:15.440 times and it's very stressful for you so
00:00:17.279 i really really appreciate your time
00:00:19.600 for people who don't know the story
00:00:22.080 there is a documentary
00:00:24.400 jeremy corbell has a documentary out
00:00:26.880 right now it's called bob lazar area 51
00:00:30.000 and ufos and flying saucers and flying
00:00:32.320 saucers bombs are air 51 and flying okay
00:00:35.520 um
00:00:36.480 i first heard your story decades ago
00:00:39.120 i've i told you last night we went out
00:00:40.879 to dinner i've seen pretty much every
00:00:43.040 interview you've ever given i've
00:00:44.559 followed the story incredibly closely
00:00:46.879 but for people who don't know the story
00:00:48.960 let's give them the bullet points you
00:00:53.280 used to work
00:00:54.719 at area 51 in area 51 you got you you
00:00:58.800 went like
00:00:59.920 well you know we want to be accurate
00:01:01.359 okay area s4 s4 okay it's about 15 miles
00:01:04.720 south of area 51. okay
00:01:07.119 um
00:01:08.080 you
00:01:08.960 worked
00:01:10.479 in
00:01:11.280 what would you how would you describe it
00:01:13.360 i i guess
00:01:14.560 within the area 51 compound you can call
00:01:17.520 that a subset of area 51.
00:01:19.920 and you got that job before that you
00:01:22.159 were working
00:01:23.759 before that i had worked at los alamos
00:01:25.920 right national labs in new mexico and
00:01:28.479 you were involved in what kind of work
00:01:30.640 nuclear weapon development physics i
00:01:32.640 mean that's they do everything there so
00:01:35.439 how do they approach you
00:01:37.119 to say hey bob once you come on out to
00:01:39.280 the nevada desert
00:01:42.320 well the way this went down was
00:01:45.200 um
00:01:47.119 at that time it was 1982
00:01:49.920 i
00:01:51.600 had put
00:01:52.720 a jet engine in my my honda
00:01:56.720 and los alamos put it on the front page
00:01:59.600 of the paper
00:02:01.119 said you know uh
00:02:02.880 los alamos man physicist at the lab you
00:02:05.280 know
00:02:06.159 built this 200 mile an hour you know on
00:02:08.720 the jet car that i drove to work every
00:02:11.120 day
00:02:11.920 so uh so i was known in los alamos the
00:02:15.120 guy with the weird car and you know you
00:02:16.720 could hear it from you know a mile away
00:02:19.440 anyway
00:02:21.760 the day that came out on the front page
00:02:23.520 of the paper
00:02:24.640 was the day edward teller the father of
00:02:26.879 the hydrogen bomb was giving
00:02:28.959 a lecture
00:02:30.160 down there at the lab
00:02:32.080 and we didn't have much going on that
00:02:34.080 day in our group and i asked if i could
00:02:36.239 go down there
00:02:38.000 and
00:02:39.920 i went down there early and ed teller
00:02:42.560 was outside
00:02:44.239 leaning on a brick wall there and
00:02:46.319 reading the front page of the paper now
00:02:48.480 there's a guy out of history so i
00:02:50.000 introduced myself hey i'm the guy you're
00:02:52.239 reading about there and we talked for a
00:02:53.599 little while and it was cool
00:02:55.519 uh you know fast forward to years later
00:02:57.519 i had moved out to las vegas
00:02:59.680 and had you know left los alamos and
00:03:02.720 you know went on to other things and i
00:03:04.239 wanted to get back into the scientific
00:03:05.840 community yeah i left start other
00:03:08.000 businesses and
00:03:09.760 and that sort of thing so i sent resumes
00:03:12.480 out and one of them went out to ed
00:03:13.760 teller and referenced our meeting
00:03:17.200 you know back back in that the day
00:03:19.519 and uh anyway he remembered me
00:03:22.480 and
00:03:23.280 gave me a reference somebody to contact
00:03:25.280 at egng
00:03:26.800 and that's pretty much how it started
00:03:29.920 so
00:03:30.879 you get a phone call or a letter like
00:03:33.519 what do you get
00:03:36.159 well i got a
00:03:38.000 what did i get i got a letter initially
00:03:41.360 and um went down for an interview
00:03:43.519 probably a couple times and it was down
00:03:45.280 at eg g special projects which was um
00:03:48.959 at mccarran airport at that time out in
00:03:50.959 las vegas and did they give you any sort
00:03:53.040 of job description of what you were
00:03:54.879 applying for um they said it was for ed
00:03:59.200 i can't remember exactly what they did
00:04:00.959 this was a long time ago but i i think
00:04:03.120 it was um
00:04:04.799 advanced propulsion or something like
00:04:06.720 that something relatively generic and
00:04:08.720 they said it's in a remote area
00:04:11.120 um
00:04:12.000 you know it's gonna be some days on some
00:04:14.080 days off and um
00:04:16.720 you know it was kind of a
00:04:18.880 it was kind of uh not exactly a
00:04:21.279 full-time job but you might have to be
00:04:22.960 out there for two weeks at a time and
00:04:25.120 take two weeks off so it was kind of uh
00:04:27.759 the work schedule would be kind of
00:04:29.040 broken up
00:04:30.240 and did this seem attractive to you or
00:04:32.560 did it seem weird
00:04:34.400 no it really wasn't weird because people
00:04:36.400 that work at the test site anybody
00:04:37.840 that's familiar with the area up there
00:04:39.840 um you know working at the nuclear test
00:04:41.919 site uh or at the tonopod test range
00:04:44.720 north of there uh that's typically how
00:04:47.360 things go so you had known about it from
00:04:49.840 the scientific community because the
00:04:51.680 area 51 at that time was no they didn't
00:04:53.680 say anything about area 51. okay so they
00:04:55.919 just said it was in a you know in a
00:04:57.840 remote location and you just know it was
00:05:00.000 up at the test site right so but there
00:05:02.479 was no mention of area 51 at that time
00:05:04.320 so they've done
00:05:05.520 hundreds of nuclear tests in nevada and
00:05:08.160 nevada that whole area was there's been
00:05:10.720 there's giant chunks of nevada the
00:05:12.400 people yeah there's a big piece of
00:05:14.240 nevada and it's split up into different
00:05:16.080 areas there's a nuclear test site
00:05:17.759 there's area 51 there's the tonopod test
00:05:20.560 range north of that there's little
00:05:22.000 sub-areas there's areas where they test
00:05:23.840 chemical weapons and things like that so
00:05:25.680 it's all broken up as a you know
00:05:27.520 gigantic test area so take me back to
00:05:29.600 first day on the job
00:05:31.840 you accept a job
00:05:33.360 they take you out there
00:05:34.960 yeah
00:05:36.000 it's um
00:05:39.520 the first day really i didn't really get
00:05:41.199 to see a whole lot the first day was
00:05:42.800 essentially just paperwork that's when i
00:05:44.560 flew into area 51 proper
00:05:47.039 and i left mccarran airport
00:05:50.400 and flew what they call the janet
00:05:51.919 flights
00:05:52.880 just um
00:05:54.800 you know a passenger plane from las
00:05:56.960 vegas to area 51
00:05:59.280 and it was really just going through
00:06:02.240 a mountain of paperwork that day
00:06:05.280 from security clearances to um
00:06:08.720 god there was
00:06:09.759 it was like two or three hours of just
00:06:11.520 solid paperwork and that was that was
00:06:13.520 really an uneventful first day
00:06:16.560 when did things get weird
00:06:21.039 when did you realize that at what point
00:06:23.360 in time did you say hey
00:06:25.759 this is not
00:06:27.120 normal work like this doesn't even seem
00:06:30.000 like it's from this planet
00:06:32.880 that i can't tell you what day that
00:06:34.639 occurred on because so much time has
00:06:36.319 gone by
00:06:37.440 the days have kind of fused into one and
00:06:39.840 i can't separate the days was it a slow
00:06:42.160 burn or was there a moment of
00:06:44.000 recognition
00:06:45.440 well the
00:06:47.600 the first inkling i had was when i i
00:06:50.319 came in normal there's this facility
00:06:52.000 that is at s4
00:06:54.080 it's in the side of a mountain
00:06:56.479 and
00:06:57.680 normally we had pulled in with the bus
00:07:00.720 and gone around the front through a
00:07:02.080 normal double door
00:07:04.720 this time that i went in there were
00:07:06.160 hangar doors open
00:07:08.160 i went into the hangar door and in the
00:07:10.160 hangar door was the disc the flying
00:07:12.560 saucer that i worked on
00:07:14.560 i saw it sitting there and we walked by
00:07:16.960 it had a little american flag stuck on
00:07:18.960 the side and i thought oh my god this
00:07:21.440 finally explains all the flying saucer
00:07:23.360 stories this is just an advanced fighter
00:07:25.360 and it this is [ __ ] hilarious right
00:07:28.160 so i went by i slid my hand alongside it
00:07:31.039 i got reprimanded immediately for
00:07:32.639 touching the thing
00:07:34.080 and uh there was a guy an armed guard
00:07:35.919 that followed us in and just said keep
00:07:37.280 your eyes at forward and your hands at
00:07:39.440 your side and just walk in the door so
00:07:41.919 that was the first time i had seen
00:07:44.080 anything that was weird
00:07:47.199 it was some time later that i was
00:07:49.360 introduced to my um
00:07:51.520 my lab partner barry
00:07:53.919 and we had some of the subcomponents of
00:07:55.840 the craft
00:07:57.440 in the lab
00:07:58.560 and barry was very anxious to get a new
00:08:01.360 lab partner so he was very talkative and
00:08:03.520 couldn't wait to show me different
00:08:04.800 things and it was in the demonstration
00:08:07.440 of the reactor working where it caught
00:08:10.160 my attention to where
00:08:13.280 this is technology that doesn't even
00:08:15.120 exist
00:08:17.520 so i mean that was the first time i knew
00:08:19.599 that this is
00:08:20.720 really something different what was it
00:08:23.599 what was it what was a
00:08:25.280 what was it about this reactor that made
00:08:28.800 you think that it didn't exist
00:08:32.159 technologically well it was the i
00:08:34.399 actually have to back up because there
00:08:35.679 were some briefings that i read it
00:08:37.279 before that
00:08:38.839 that
00:08:40.640 you know certainly gave me the
00:08:42.559 impression that this was going to be a
00:08:44.000 weird job but this was the first
00:08:45.519 hands-on thing
00:08:47.040 this was a small reactor about the size
00:08:49.120 of a hemisphere about the size of a
00:08:51.040 basketball
00:08:52.240 on a metal plate and when it was running
00:08:55.839 it produced a gravitational field a
00:08:57.760 gravitational field of its own now this
00:08:59.519 is something that we can't do we can't
00:09:01.600 produce any gravity the only way we get
00:09:04.720 gravity is from large quantities of mass
00:09:07.360 but there's no machine we can have that
00:09:09.279 turns on that makes gravity like
00:09:11.600 you know you can turn on an
00:09:12.480 electromagnet and it makes a magnetic
00:09:14.720 field we can't make a gravitational
00:09:16.560 field anyway this device was producing
00:09:19.120 that and barry said
00:09:21.839 almost like he was bragging go ahead try
00:09:23.920 and try and touch the sphere and i i
00:09:26.080 couldn't it would it pushed my hands
00:09:27.760 away just like two like poles of a
00:09:29.440 magnet so that was uh so like when you
00:09:31.440 take two magnets and try to press them
00:09:32.720 together yeah you have this each other
00:09:34.560 yeah kind of cushion feeling but you
00:09:36.800 can't you can't get them together the
00:09:38.399 closer you put them the more they push
00:09:39.839 but then you felt that physically with
00:09:41.120 my hand yeah now there's nothing there's
00:09:43.120 nothing that does that
00:09:44.720 and that immediately caught my attention
00:09:46.640 going wow this is something else what
00:09:49.440 was your thought like when you felt that
00:09:51.600 and you knew that there was nothing that
00:09:53.680 you were aware of that could produce
00:09:55.920 that connected me to the briefings that
00:09:57.760 i read
00:09:59.120 on the the first day at s4 was that uh
00:10:02.959 you know everything that i had read was
00:10:04.800 apparently accurate
00:10:06.560 what were you reading
00:10:08.000 i read it was kind of an overview
00:10:11.200 this project
00:10:12.640 was to back engineer
00:10:15.040 the alien craft and
00:10:17.600 specifically it was to try and back
00:10:20.000 engineer and see if we can duplicate the
00:10:22.000 technology with available materials
00:10:26.160 now to do this they split the project
00:10:28.640 into
00:10:29.839 you know many different pieces for
00:10:31.920 several reasons they do this on all
00:10:33.519 classified projects so uh nobody has the
00:10:36.560 complete story but uh they
00:10:38.560 compartmentalize everything now we had
00:10:40.720 the power and propulsion system so what
00:10:43.040 the briefings they gave me were like a
00:10:44.880 one or two page overview of some of the
00:10:46.959 other projects that were going on you
00:10:49.279 know on the craft the only reason they
00:10:51.360 do that is just in case what you're
00:10:53.440 working on is connected intimately in
00:10:55.760 some way that we don't know of to one of
00:10:57.360 the other projects you have to know
00:10:58.640 there excuse me their existence so
00:11:02.160 um
00:11:03.920 you know i but
00:11:05.279 again everything from metallurgy to
00:11:08.399 um you know weapon potential the craft
00:11:11.120 and these were all you know essentially
00:11:13.920 very short briefings but mine was just
00:11:16.399 power and propulsion and
00:11:19.120 it made it very clear that what i read
00:11:21.760 was accurate
00:11:23.200 so when you're reading that before you
00:11:25.279 actually saw the reactor
00:11:28.000 what were your thoughts on what they
00:11:29.279 were describing
00:11:32.560 if you knew that something like that
00:11:33.920 didn't exist
00:11:35.680 and they're describing it in the
00:11:36.640 briefings
00:11:38.079 what did you think you were going to see
00:11:40.000 i really i i didn't know at the time i
00:11:42.480 mean i was reading i thought is this
00:11:44.079 just some kind of test
00:11:45.920 um
00:11:46.720 see if you're crazy well not to see if
00:11:48.560 i'm crazy to
00:11:50.000 you know a lot of times they'll take in
00:11:51.839 real high security
00:11:53.920 uh
00:11:54.720 jobs i mean they'll intentionally insert
00:11:57.360 nonsense into them um whether it's to
00:12:00.000 confuse the fact or if for someone was
00:12:02.320 to leak it out
00:12:03.680 they would carry that information along
00:12:05.519 and know where it came from so
00:12:07.440 i
00:12:08.399 read through the documents but you know
00:12:10.880 i didn't know if this was you know part
00:12:12.880 of some kind of test or um
00:12:16.320 you know or what or was it potentially
00:12:18.320 realistic i mean i really didn't
00:12:20.000 consider it being
00:12:22.160 all that possible as far as being uh
00:12:25.519 the actual thing that i was going to
00:12:27.120 work on at the time how did they turn it
00:12:29.279 on
00:12:30.480 the the reactor yeah the reactor can be
00:12:32.959 turned on or turned off in a lot of
00:12:34.720 different ways um the way barry showed
00:12:37.279 me at the hemisphere is removed
00:12:40.399 there's a small tower in the middle when
00:12:42.079 you put the hemisphere on the reactor
00:12:44.160 activates
00:12:45.440 the reactor shuts down it's it's load
00:12:48.399 sensing so if there's if there's no load
00:12:51.680 on the reactor at all it shuts down when
00:12:53.680 there's a load present on it it starts
00:12:56.320 up again load meaning
00:12:58.720 you can consider it an electrical load
00:13:01.279 so
00:13:02.959 although it doesn't necessarily operate
00:13:06.079 electrically there's no wiring that
00:13:08.240 connects any of the sub components
00:13:10.000 together whatsoever they just have to be
00:13:11.680 in the immediate vicinity it's uh
00:13:14.720 it is but the stuff is borderline magic
00:13:18.000 and that's essentially where we left it
00:13:20.720 you know when i left the project
00:13:23.040 so there was no progress made
00:13:25.760 there was some progress i mean we did
00:13:27.360 identify at least we think some
00:13:29.279 processes and
00:13:30.720 and had a rough idea we think of what
00:13:33.040 was going on but
00:13:35.200 i think this is a problem
00:13:37.200 that they've had for a long time
00:13:39.600 and um
00:13:40.959 you know i was replacing somebody
00:13:43.519 that barry worked with prior to me and i
00:13:45.600 think there was some horrific accident
00:13:47.680 that i didn't have a whole lot of
00:13:49.440 information on but you know barry
00:13:51.360 alluded to that
00:13:53.040 horrific accident like where someone
00:13:54.880 died or yeah where somebody died because
00:13:57.440 they were trying to tamper with things
00:13:59.120 or figure out how something worked yeah
00:14:01.440 the reactor in particular
00:14:03.440 but yeti let you touch it
00:14:05.920 yeah i think what they were trying to do
00:14:07.760 was cut into one now they had they had
00:14:10.639 more than one there and they that was
00:14:12.399 supposedly there was an unannounced
00:14:14.160 nuclear test
00:14:15.680 and
00:14:16.480 that's what it was at the time remember
00:14:18.560 they would still do an underground
00:14:19.680 nuclear test at the test site um but
00:14:22.800 from what i understand according to
00:14:24.639 barry there was an attempt made now this
00:14:26.800 must have been a pretty desperate intent
00:14:28.399 because it's not a very scientific
00:14:30.800 process to cut you know analyze
00:14:32.959 something that way but it looked like
00:14:34.639 they used a plasma cutter or something
00:14:36.240 like that to cut into an
00:14:38.160 operating reactor how many of these
00:14:40.000 things did they have they had nine nine
00:14:42.480 craft altogether i only got hands on
00:14:45.040 with one of them so i can't really
00:14:47.920 say what the how the others operated did
00:14:50.000 you see the other ones yeah at one time
00:14:52.399 and only one time the bay doors that
00:14:54.720 between the hangers were all open and i
00:14:57.120 could see all the way through
00:14:59.680 and
00:15:00.639 were they all exactly the same no they
00:15:02.480 were all different different shapes yeah
00:15:05.279 but they were all from somewhere else
00:15:07.680 yeah absolutely
00:15:09.360 now
00:15:10.240 did anyone make any attempt to explain
00:15:13.519 or to
00:15:14.800 to tell you where they came from no no
00:15:17.839 no one is the least bit interested in
00:15:19.839 letting everybody know
00:15:21.519 all the facts they want to give you the
00:15:23.120 minimum information that's necessary to
00:15:25.199 complete your task so
00:15:27.040 you're not getting the story of where
00:15:28.399 they came from you're not getting the
00:15:30.560 story of what how much progress other
00:15:32.560 people are making you just focus on
00:15:35.360 the small component but they gave you
00:15:37.279 some indication that they've been
00:15:38.480 working on these for a while yeah
00:15:41.279 when do you think they
00:15:43.199 acquired these
00:15:45.040 i really couldn't say
00:15:47.279 i think they've been around for a while
00:15:50.560 so
00:15:51.360 they bring you into this room you
00:15:54.399 see this reactor working you you realize
00:15:57.279 this is nothing that as far as like the
00:15:59.440 scientific community at current time
00:16:02.320 has the ability to create
00:16:05.040 we still don't
00:16:06.399 what is your life like from that moment
00:16:08.399 on is that where everything changes
00:16:09.839 because you do you i mean i would
00:16:11.759 imagine the moment you actually make
00:16:13.920 contact with something that's
00:16:15.920 extraterrestrial whether it's an object
00:16:17.519 or a being something where you can
00:16:19.279 actually absolutely be certain it's not
00:16:22.000 from here
00:16:23.199 your whole paradigm the whole world you
00:16:26.240 live in is now a different place well
00:16:28.320 this is the only time it became exciting
00:16:31.199 you know the rest of the time the it was
00:16:33.199 really
00:16:34.480 an ominous feeling being at work but it
00:16:37.040 at that time
00:16:38.399 it was exciting i mean this was now i
00:16:41.279 knew we were on the absolute be actually
00:16:43.680 beyond the cutting edge of science and i
00:16:45.839 was
00:16:46.880 i was so absolutely excited to be there
00:16:49.759 every single time i was um
00:16:52.720 you know it would this was a fantastic
00:16:54.800 opportunity and
00:16:58.000 however
00:17:00.320 in short order it began to concern me we
00:17:04.400 really have no idea what we're talking
00:17:06.720 about
00:17:07.839 and
00:17:09.679 the excitement kind of turned to dread
00:17:12.559 at some point
00:17:14.000 because the amount of power we're
00:17:16.319 dealing with is astronomical i mean to
00:17:19.839 affect gravity to produce the effects
00:17:22.480 like this equipment does takes huge
00:17:25.359 amounts of power and i've given the
00:17:29.120 example before of
00:17:30.799 you know taking a small portable nuclear
00:17:32.880 reactor and you know putting it back
00:17:34.880 into victorian times you know with the
00:17:36.799 scientists of the time and just dropping
00:17:39.520 it in a room and they come and look at
00:17:41.600 it and see that it's producing power
00:17:43.919 and wonder how it works so they start
00:17:45.679 taking it apart
00:17:47.200 and
00:17:48.240 as soon as they get some of the
00:17:49.440 shielding off the people are going to
00:17:50.960 drop dead because of the radiation
00:17:52.559 inside
00:17:53.600 now the people have no idea that
00:17:56.400 radiation even exists back then
00:17:58.720 but anybody that comes in to check on
00:18:00.400 him will also drop dead and
00:18:03.360 you know
00:18:04.640 there's no reason that that exact
00:18:06.559 scenario couldn't happen with what we're
00:18:08.960 dealing with we have no idea how the
00:18:11.760 physics operate within this thing the
00:18:14.480 power levels are are like i said
00:18:16.480 astronomic like it's incredibly
00:18:18.559 dangerous to tinker with something like
00:18:20.400 that
00:18:21.200 and you know in some respects we were
00:18:23.679 guinea pigs just try to find out how to
00:18:25.520 make this thing so they had a series
00:18:28.400 as far as you're
00:18:29.919 surmised that a series of different
00:18:31.919 scientists try to back engineer this
00:18:33.760 thing try to figure out what this thing
00:18:35.280 was and they would bring in new people
00:18:36.960 and like let's throw bob at it yeah yeah
00:18:39.679 and they i know i don't know how many
00:18:41.280 but i knew there was certainly one
00:18:42.880 before me and i knew he died
00:18:45.679 during the analysis of the or the
00:18:47.679 reactor itself and
00:18:51.120 you don't know how many have worked on
00:18:53.440 it and no one
00:18:54.880 gave this could have been there for
00:18:56.960 50 years it could have been there for
00:18:58.559 five years when they're giving you
00:18:59.919 instructions what are they saying like
00:19:02.080 when they're giving you direction
00:19:03.039 they're showing you all the stuff like
00:19:04.240 what what are they saying what
00:19:05.919 specifically what are they asking of you
00:19:08.240 well essentially what they ask is is
00:19:10.559 what i said all we are just to gather as
00:19:12.640 much information as possible find out
00:19:14.480 how it operates and see if we can
00:19:16.000 duplicate it so but they always realize
00:19:18.080 you where it was from they never let you
00:19:20.799 ask questions about where it's from well
00:19:24.080 if
00:19:25.039 the information i read in the briefings
00:19:26.799 was accurate now what i do have to say
00:19:29.120 is
00:19:29.840 the information that pertained directly
00:19:32.160 to the reactor
00:19:33.760 was accurate what i read
00:19:36.960 did
00:19:38.480 i mean did jive with reality um in terms
00:19:41.679 of how
00:19:42.960 in terms of how it was made how what we
00:19:45.280 saw how it operated the materials how it
00:19:48.480 you know turned on and what was
00:19:50.240 discovered uh
00:19:52.559 discovered about it
00:19:54.160 i'm sorry the migraine is really making
00:19:56.080 it hard for me to thank you sorry no
00:19:58.320 we talked that before the podcast you
00:20:00.000 tell her buddy bob is getting a migraine
00:20:01.440 i know you're very stressed out by this
00:20:02.880 which is one of the reasons why i
00:20:03.919 appreciate you doing this
00:20:05.360 um
00:20:07.120 where was i already we were talking oh
00:20:08.720 right yeah explained it
00:20:10.400 and uh
00:20:11.919 so there was some paperwork that
00:20:15.120 indicated that this was from the zeta
00:20:17.280 reticuli star system now
00:20:20.640 yeah now how they obtain that i haven't
00:20:24.080 i haven't the slightest idea but it
00:20:26.400 wasn't just from the zeta reticuli star
00:20:28.159 system it was
00:20:29.760 what they called zr3 so it was a third
00:20:32.240 planet in that star system so
00:20:35.679 there was no other information about it
00:20:37.679 other than that supposedly where the
00:20:39.760 craft came from now is that true i don't
00:20:41.840 know i have no way of verifying that but
00:20:43.280 that was printed in the same materials
00:20:45.120 that referenced the reactor now i looked
00:20:47.840 that stuff up when i went home
00:20:50.159 and
00:20:51.360 zeta reticular is a binary star
00:20:54.720 two stars that orbit orbit one another
00:20:56.960 and it's only visible in the southern
00:20:58.320 hemisphere and it's about thirty some
00:21:00.000 odd light years away so that's literally
00:21:02.640 all the information i have about that i
00:21:04.240 don't know how they found out it came
00:21:06.480 from there and you also probably have
00:21:08.400 some suspicions that they give you some
00:21:10.720 disinformation like you were talking
00:21:12.159 about before they would yeah yeah to
00:21:15.600 i mean if you ever decided to talk about
00:21:17.360 this they added a bunch of nonsense to
00:21:19.039 make whatever is factual look ridiculous
00:21:21.760 right or be able to trace it down like
00:21:24.159 hey this facts came out and you know
00:21:26.000 this lazar guy said it you know came
00:21:28.080 from zeta reticulate so they knew it was
00:21:30.480 when we read zeta reticulate we're like
00:21:32.960 what in the [ __ ] is this well reading
00:21:36.320 all of this stuff it was what in the
00:21:37.919 [ __ ] is this you're like why did i sign
00:21:39.679 up for this
00:21:40.640 no no
00:21:41.520 to me this was cool this is interesting
00:21:43.600 i said i was just excited to be out in a
00:21:45.760 secure area you know in the middle of
00:21:47.520 the desert i said this is awesome how
00:21:49.360 old are you
00:21:50.720 i get as in my 20s
00:21:53.200 yeah so you're probably
00:21:54.720 totally geeked out oh yeah
00:21:56.799 this was this was great i mean i i was
00:21:59.440 excited so i didn't care
00:22:01.200 reading through everything and so you
00:22:02.799 read through all the zeta reticuli thing
00:22:04.240 but then when you see the actual
00:22:05.600 starship with the little american flag
00:22:07.360 sticker on it well that was
00:22:10.080 was that later or before
00:22:12.960 that
00:22:14.480 that was before so before so you see the
00:22:17.120 thing before and you say oh this is
00:22:18.799 where what's that before
00:22:20.320 hard so many years yeah i can't
00:22:22.960 either way it doesn't matter the days
00:22:24.400 have fused together it's so hard to
00:22:26.320 separate what happened in each visit do
00:22:28.799 you remember the thought process when
00:22:30.159 you read that it's from zeta reticuli
00:22:32.400 yeah it it it it didn't hit me like a
00:22:34.960 ton of bricks or anything it's just like
00:22:37.039 yeah okay
00:22:38.400 you think it was [ __ ] i don't know
00:22:40.320 this is where i don't know now i don't i
00:22:42.080 mean because when i read it i hadn't
00:22:44.240 verified anything and this was just a
00:22:45.840 bunch of stuff i was reading and i
00:22:47.840 thought maybe after this they're just
00:22:49.200 going to give me a test and see what i
00:22:50.880 can remember in right crazy information
00:22:53.520 and it would but
00:22:55.760 like i said when i finally
00:22:57.840 went in with barry
00:22:59.360 um
00:23:01.200 and had hands-on
00:23:02.880 experience with what they were talking
00:23:04.640 about
00:23:05.679 it taught on a completely different
00:23:07.280 meaning so there's a plate there's this
00:23:09.760 thing that looks like a half a
00:23:10.799 basketball and when it's on you can't
00:23:12.960 come anywhere near it you can't touch it
00:23:14.720 right how is
00:23:16.559 what is
00:23:17.679 gravity about that like the the concept
00:23:20.000 of gravity to most people gravity is
00:23:21.520 bringing something towards it right well
00:23:22.960 i guess you would say it's anti-gravity
00:23:25.120 it's gravity shifted 180 degrees it's uh
00:23:28.240 you know
00:23:29.840 anti-gravity
00:23:31.200 and did they have any understanding
00:23:34.320 about what could possibly create this
00:23:36.720 effect
00:23:38.000 did they have any
00:23:39.440 areas where they'd like you to look into
00:23:42.559 no they
00:23:46.080 well
00:23:47.280 they knew there was a fuel source in it
00:23:50.080 and they were proficient
00:23:52.080 at making it work
00:23:53.919 and again my analogy to something like
00:23:55.760 this is you can drop a motorcycle off in
00:23:58.080 the wagon train days and just leave it
00:23:59.840 with the keys parked outside you know
00:24:01.919 somebody's place everybody will come
00:24:04.000 around it and they'll poke and prod and
00:24:05.679 eventually they'll turn the key get it
00:24:07.679 to start and become proficient at
00:24:09.840 writing it
00:24:10.880 yeah but they won't be able to
00:24:13.600 understand what the hell's going on they
00:24:15.440 won't be able to make the plastic fender
00:24:17.520 much less anything else and i think
00:24:19.360 that's exactly the state we were at we
00:24:21.760 played around with the parts long enough
00:24:23.360 before i got there where they could make
00:24:25.279 the reactor operate
00:24:27.919 take the fuel out and know that it makes
00:24:30.480 it work
00:24:32.559 how exactly what was going on
00:24:35.360 in the reactor
00:24:36.960 remained a mystery at the time
00:24:39.919 i think we made some progress on
00:24:42.720 what was going on inside but i don't
00:24:45.440 think anybody really knew anything they
00:24:47.520 could just watch what was going on and
00:24:49.600 make note of it how long were you there
00:24:52.320 i'd say about six months or so and what
00:24:54.720 what progress was made while you were
00:24:56.559 there
00:24:57.760 well we came up with a bunch of
00:25:01.760 reasonably good ideas about how the
00:25:03.760 reactor worked
00:25:05.360 and one of them was the base the square
00:25:08.080 base of it was essentially like a
00:25:10.000 cyclotron which is a small particle
00:25:11.840 accelerator a circular one particle
00:25:14.640 accelerators linear particle
00:25:16.159 accelerators are just a you know
00:25:18.640 long tube essentially and they
00:25:20.080 accelerate particles with high voltage
00:25:21.760 and you know radio frequencies till they
00:25:23.919 reach high speeds but a cyclotron does
00:25:26.240 that in a smaller circular area and
00:25:29.600 there is this
00:25:31.360 very heavy element fuel element 115
00:25:34.159 something that wasn't on our periodic
00:25:35.760 charts
00:25:36.720 at the time but it is now it is now yeah
00:25:39.760 when did it become on the periodic table
00:25:42.159 now the way the charts now you know i
00:25:44.080 don't remember do you remember when they
00:25:46.400 2004
00:25:47.919 durhamstat germany i think is where they
00:25:49.840 first fabricated four atoms they lasted
00:25:51.760 220 milliseconds with the atoms it's
00:25:54.080 nothing right and then it later was
00:25:56.480 discovered a couple more times they
00:25:57.760 could fabricate it then they gave it
00:25:59.760 they gave it a place then on the
00:26:01.520 periodic chart after that called it
00:26:03.360 muscovium so they told you about this
00:26:06.240 stuff in
00:26:08.840 1982 yeah well we can 82 what what year
00:26:12.880 was this it was 88 and 89 when i was
00:26:16.000 there 82 is one 82 was when you're in
00:26:18.000 los alamos i'm sorry yeah so 88.89 they
00:26:21.279 told you about this stuff so this was
00:26:22.640 not like no they didn't they didn't tell
00:26:24.400 me about it that's one of the things
00:26:26.320 that this group came up with
00:26:28.240 the um
00:26:30.480 um
00:26:31.679 i keep losing my train of thought with
00:26:33.440 this thing
00:26:34.480 so this one area this
00:26:37.679 this element 115 was the fuel yeah it
00:26:41.039 was the fuel um
00:26:50.960 the the world will forgive you for
00:26:52.480 having a migraine i can i just it's
00:26:54.320 really hard to think throughout this
00:26:55.600 case
00:26:57.120 i just want to say one yeah definitely
00:26:58.559 as i said one thing you know but for the
00:27:00.880 last 30 years
00:27:02.480 people have just been on the attack on
00:27:04.159 bob you know getting to know him the
00:27:05.919 personal effects on his life it's really
00:27:08.240 hard to understand unless you meet his
00:27:10.080 family and his wife
00:27:11.600 i mean this is the last thing he wanted
00:27:13.600 to [ __ ] do was have to talk yeah we
00:27:16.000 should explain that jeremy you and i had
00:27:17.840 this conversation i watched your
00:27:19.120 documentary
00:27:20.640 we had this conversation and i said i
00:27:23.120 have to talk to him yeah the document
00:27:25.200 there's there's been detractors there's
00:27:27.840 been a bunch of people that called
00:27:29.279 [ __ ] on many of the things that
00:27:30.640 you've said but over time
00:27:33.120 many of the things that you talked about
00:27:35.760 even in the 80s have proven to be true
00:27:38.640 things that people said were not true
00:27:40.400 were proven to be true element 115 was
00:27:42.960 one of them
00:27:44.480 right right right
00:27:46.559 element 115 the fuel they had was stable
00:27:50.000 in other words it didn't decay it wasn't
00:27:51.520 emitting radioactivity um when they
00:27:54.399 synthesized the two or three atoms of
00:27:57.520 the 115 uh it did decay
00:28:00.320 and it was not a stable element so
00:28:02.799 they're they're kind of two different
00:28:04.000 things but this is kind of typical
00:28:06.000 elements
00:28:07.360 always have or pretty much always have
00:28:09.600 uh stable isotopes and unstable isotopes
00:28:12.480 like i think cesium has like
00:28:14.880 30 unstable isotopes to it so all right
00:28:17.760 well hydrogen for example you're
00:28:19.279 familiar with hydrogen gas
00:28:22.399 it's stable it's not radioactive but
00:28:24.559 there's also two other types of hydrogen
00:28:28.000 deuterium and tritium and deuterium
00:28:30.960 isn't radioactive it's another
00:28:33.120 stable isotope hydrogen but tritium is
00:28:35.440 radioactive now they're all hydrogen but
00:28:38.080 they just have a different amounts of
00:28:39.360 neutrons so it's the same thing with
00:28:42.480 other elements n element 115. depending
00:28:45.200 on the amount of neutrons it has
00:28:48.640 designates the isotope but it's 115 they
00:28:52.080 will continue to take
00:28:55.520 or experiment and try and make 115 at
00:28:58.640 different isotopes and i'm sure
00:28:59.840 eventually they'll come up with a stable
00:29:01.440 version but it's the stable version that
00:29:04.000 has the properties that we're talking
00:29:05.600 about so they somehow or another had
00:29:08.559 acquired a stable version did they say
00:29:10.480 that the stable version had come with
00:29:12.000 this craft it absolutely came with the
00:29:13.760 graft yeah so at the time you having a
00:29:17.440 firm knowledge of the periodic chart and
00:29:19.679 knowing what was real and what wasn't
00:29:21.279 real what was your reaction to having
00:29:23.679 this stable element 115 that wasn't even
00:29:26.480 supposed to exist well everything was
00:29:28.240 impossible right i mean down down to the
00:29:30.880 metal i i did get a chance
00:29:33.440 uh to look inside the craft on only one
00:29:36.399 occasion and this was important because
00:29:40.320 where the reactor sat
00:29:42.240 might have been critical to how it
00:29:43.840 operated since everything operates
00:29:46.080 without any interconnection so the
00:29:47.919 placement of components might be
00:29:50.000 critical so they allowed me to go inside
00:29:52.480 and and look at it
00:29:55.120 um
00:29:56.159 dude again i forgot where the hell i am
00:29:58.080 so you're going into this craft and what
00:30:00.880 are you thinking when you're inside of
00:30:02.320 it like what are you seeing it's um
00:30:05.840 it's a very ominous feeling because it's
00:30:09.520 there are no at first of all everything
00:30:11.600 is one color it's like a dark pewter
00:30:13.600 color
00:30:14.559 and there are no right angles anywhere
00:30:17.919 it's as if somebody took uh i've said
00:30:20.240 this before somebody took a a model out
00:30:23.120 of
00:30:23.760 and fashioned it out of wax and then
00:30:26.000 heated it just for a short time so
00:30:27.840 everything melted everything looks like
00:30:29.520 it's fused together everything has a
00:30:31.200 radius of curvature where two uh items
00:30:34.640 meet it's uh it's a really weird looking
00:30:37.919 thing
00:30:38.960 but um
00:30:41.279 uh
00:30:42.640 there was almost nothing
00:30:44.559 other than a small foldable hatchway
00:30:47.840 that
00:30:48.799 that looked recognizable everything was
00:30:51.120 uh
00:30:52.399 was really unworldly
00:30:54.320 depicting it a way to describe it so you
00:30:57.679 you get inside this thing and it's
00:30:59.440 designed for something that's much
00:31:01.039 smaller than a human being yeah you
00:31:02.640 can't really stand up till you get to
00:31:04.080 the very center of it and how tall are
00:31:05.600 you
00:31:06.320 i'm 5 10. and what do you think this was
00:31:08.960 designed for i'd say something close to
00:31:11.360 half my height wow
00:31:13.600 so these little
00:31:14.880 three foot tallish creatures
00:31:16.960 yeah and the the seats were small too i
00:31:19.360 mean obviously it was made you know for
00:31:21.440 something something small but there's no
00:31:25.360 like there's there's nothing else in
00:31:27.520 there there's just seats the reactor and
00:31:29.840 some of the sub components there's no
00:31:31.600 there's no control panels there's no
00:31:33.520 bathroom there's no
00:31:35.200 no decorative uh components or artwork
00:31:38.399 or anything that you would recognize or
00:31:40.720 trim i mean it's just a very bare bones
00:31:43.440 thing you're not seeing any screens
00:31:46.960 well there are archways around it that
00:31:49.519 are part of the superstructure
00:31:51.440 and
00:31:52.640 that one of the archways can become
00:31:54.880 transparent
00:31:56.559 when i was in there there was another
00:31:58.159 group working on one of the archways and
00:32:01.840 you could call that a screen more or
00:32:04.000 less
00:32:04.960 so through that archway it would be it
00:32:07.600 would maintain the solidity the the
00:32:10.640 solid
00:32:11.760 whatever metal it was yeah but you could
00:32:14.080 yeah it just became transparent yeah i
00:32:16.799 saw that happen once or twice before i
00:32:18.880 left did you ask any questions about
00:32:20.399 what the phone no there's no there's no
00:32:22.240 asking questions no
00:32:23.919 but when you watch something become
00:32:25.600 transparent and you realize it's still
00:32:27.760 there but you could now see through it
00:32:29.279 yeah i mean now that's not that
00:32:31.679 impressive we do have some liquid
00:32:33.360 crystal materials that are like that
00:32:35.519 you know they are seen in smart glass
00:32:37.679 yeah they call it smart glass so this is
00:32:39.519 just uh and i don't know if the craft is
00:32:41.679 made of
00:32:42.720 you know an advanced metal or a ceramic
00:32:45.279 it was cold to the touch
00:32:47.200 so um you know i would lean in more
00:32:49.360 towards the metal you're not allowed to
00:32:50.960 ask questions
00:32:52.240 no the only there they work on the buddy
00:32:54.799 system so i can only exchange ideas and
00:32:57.519 talk to barry
00:32:59.279 now this really interferes with science
00:33:02.159 because science is based on free
00:33:03.600 discussion and ideally you get a bunch
00:33:05.919 of guys together exchange ideas work on
00:33:08.080 problems and that's how things move
00:33:09.600 forward
00:33:10.399 but they're so over the top concerned
00:33:13.279 about security they split everything off
00:33:16.159 and
00:33:17.200 everybody becomes stagnant it it
00:33:20.640 it just destroys any of the progress you
00:33:23.360 can make or at least makes it go so slow
00:33:26.399 um they i think they wind up shooting
00:33:28.320 themselves in the foot which is probably
00:33:30.240 why they
00:33:31.440 arrived at this bottleneck that they
00:33:33.519 needed to get this madman with a jet
00:33:35.919 powered honda to come in and see what he
00:33:37.760 could do i think that was an act of
00:33:39.360 desperation i think they wanted someone
00:33:41.200 that thinks out of the box and let's
00:33:43.039 just give this guy a try here because
00:33:45.120 they weren't and uh they might have done
00:33:47.120 this
00:33:47.919 four more times since uh you know up to
00:33:50.559 the point in time today assuming they're
00:33:52.080 still working on this thing
00:33:54.159 and when you see this craft and you're
00:33:57.440 inside was there any
00:33:59.440 indication that there was an area that
00:34:01.760 they would use to control it to pilot
00:34:04.240 was there a pilot seat
00:34:06.480 was there's there were three seats they
00:34:08.399 sat around uh the reactor was in the
00:34:11.040 dead center of it
00:34:12.639 and then equidistant around there were
00:34:14.800 three seats
00:34:16.320 so and that's all there was a a large
00:34:19.520 you would they're not consoles there are
00:34:21.599 large rectangular objects also spaced
00:34:24.960 equidistant around the center um there's
00:34:27.839 nothing on them there's no buttons
00:34:29.280 there's no lights and they control the
00:34:31.119 same color everything is the same color
00:34:33.359 different shape right
00:34:34.879 and um
00:34:36.560 directly underneath them there's three
00:34:38.239 levels in the craft uh the main level is
00:34:41.199 what we're talking about directly under
00:34:43.359 that
00:34:44.639 those are the gravity amplifiers the big
00:34:46.560 rectangular objects underneath them are
00:34:48.960 the gravity emitters that look like for
00:34:51.440 lack of a better word a trash can
00:34:53.119 hanging on a pipe three of those and
00:34:55.760 then the top layer
00:34:58.079 i this is just my personal belief i
00:35:00.160 think that has to do with a
00:35:02.400 a navigation or their version of a
00:35:04.400 computer uh with some planar panels
00:35:08.240 sensor panels around the craft that we
00:35:10.160 would call portholes but they're not
00:35:11.920 portholes they're just black areas and i
00:35:14.160 think that just determines its
00:35:16.800 you know position in space
00:35:18.720 but i was i i physically was in the
00:35:21.520 center section and i stuck my torso in
00:35:24.560 the bottom section and hung upside down
00:35:26.320 so i could see
00:35:27.599 how the gravity amplifiers were
00:35:29.520 positioned
00:35:30.400 what is the the roughly the size of this
00:35:32.240 thing it's a i think it
00:35:34.480 i don't remember from being there but um
00:35:37.520 after all this stuff was over i had uh
00:35:40.160 john andrews a guy from the testers
00:35:42.000 model corporation and you know we sat
00:35:44.320 down and tried to figure out from what i
00:35:47.280 saw
00:35:48.560 um
00:35:49.680 and known sizes of things and we came up
00:35:51.760 with 52 feet in diameter
00:35:54.640 so i think that's really small yeah so i
00:35:56.720 think that's a fair a reasonable guess
00:35:59.520 now you said there's nine of them and
00:36:00.960 you got a brief glimpse at the other
00:36:02.960 ones were they how are they different
00:36:05.440 oh
00:36:06.480 they looked completely different one
00:36:08.000 looked like i called it jello mold and
00:36:10.400 it it looked like a classic jello mold
00:36:12.720 with the rippled sides to it one was a
00:36:14.800 very flat disc
00:36:16.560 um
00:36:18.800 you know like a
00:36:20.240 oh i don't like a straw hat or something
00:36:22.160 like that that was sitting up on its
00:36:24.160 edge and the thin part of it had looked
00:36:27.200 like a projectile had been fired through
00:36:30.480 the edge of it so i don't know if they
00:36:32.320 were attempting to see if the metal
00:36:34.640 could be penetrated or if something or
00:36:37.359 if that's
00:36:38.400 where the thing came from maybe it was
00:36:40.000 shot down um but that was the only one
00:36:42.800 where i saw there was you know actual
00:36:44.720 physical damage to it
00:36:46.720 and that one was roughly the same size
00:36:49.040 they're all uh they were kind of too far
00:36:50.640 away to tell
00:36:52.880 and did
00:36:54.640 there was several teams that were
00:36:56.400 working on the propulsion system so
00:36:57.760 there was different teams that were
00:36:59.119 working on these different aircrafts i i
00:37:01.839 don't know i could only assume
00:37:05.280 now when you're
00:37:06.800 sitting in this thing
00:37:08.400 and you're looking at this
00:37:10.720 otherworldly craft
00:37:12.720 your your goal is to try to figure out
00:37:14.560 how this thing functions your goal is to
00:37:17.040 try to figure out how this reactor
00:37:19.599 i mean but you would imagine they would
00:37:21.599 give you more time than just one day to
00:37:23.200 check that out oh yeah it wasn't one day
00:37:25.680 right
00:37:26.880 yeah i mean this is barry was there
00:37:29.440 i think barry was sleeping there i'm
00:37:31.760 sure they had now
00:37:33.359 that that isn't weird i mean up at the
00:37:35.040 toenap test range where they work on
00:37:36.640 stealth fighters you know you go i think
00:37:40.160 three weeks on one week off and you stay
00:37:42.480 up there too so it's not weird to stay
00:37:44.240 up at the test site right so um yeah i
00:37:46.880 think he pretty much didn't he acted
00:37:48.720 like he's been up there for a long time
00:37:50.720 yeah um
00:37:52.240 but he's still there yeah who knows do
00:37:54.880 you do you have contact with this guy no
00:37:57.200 oh no i wish i did i kind of thought he
00:37:59.920 was going to come out after i did right
00:38:03.040 and i think i took so much flack and
00:38:06.400 it's so much [ __ ] for what went on
00:38:09.040 i think i actually i wound up helping
00:38:11.040 security there and everybody became
00:38:13.280 afraid of you know doing or saying
00:38:15.520 anything after that
00:38:17.119 so what kind of reports did you have to
00:38:20.079 give like so you're not making much
00:38:21.760 progress right you're just trying to
00:38:22.960 figure out what this thing is and it
00:38:24.320 seems impossible so well we didn't
00:38:26.640 personally make them i mean we were
00:38:28.800 always there was never a lot of
00:38:31.040 information
00:38:32.400 that we gained um
00:38:34.640 the guy
00:38:35.760 you would call him our supervisor his
00:38:37.359 name was dennis mariani
00:38:39.280 and kind of a military looking guy and
00:38:42.320 he would routinely pop in you know
00:38:44.880 during the day and you know hey what's
00:38:47.680 going on guys and he would essentially
00:38:50.240 relay any information anything new we
00:38:52.480 came up with i mean he was our
00:38:54.000 go-between you know where we presented
00:38:56.480 him the information then he took it to
00:38:58.320 wherever they were
00:38:59.680 you know
00:39:00.560 assembling all the data from everybody
00:39:02.400 no i assume you're working normal days
00:39:04.480 like an eight-hour day no
00:39:06.400 no
00:39:07.119 no it was really weird that i would be
00:39:09.760 only called in on certain times and
00:39:11.520 certain days and they would be weird
00:39:13.680 hours too
00:39:15.200 most of the time was later in the
00:39:16.720 evening i mean i can get a call at 11
00:39:18.640 o'clock at night and they'll say you
00:39:20.480 know it's now 11 o'clock
00:39:22.400 um
00:39:23.760 by 11 45 you need to be at mccarran
00:39:26.560 terminal and um
00:39:29.119 you know we'll let you know when
00:39:31.440 we have more information but what did
00:39:33.200 you do while you were there if you're
00:39:35.760 looking at this
00:39:37.119 object this
00:39:38.560 reactor and you can't figure out what it
00:39:41.119 is or how it works other than the fact
00:39:43.040 that it works on this element that we
00:39:44.720 don't even know about sure i mean the
00:39:46.400 thing was to
00:39:48.000 what you do in you know
00:39:50.800 with anything if you're trying to
00:39:52.240 analyze it all you can do is perform
00:39:54.079 tests
00:39:55.440 and all we did is try and come up with
00:39:57.920 every kind of test we possibly could i
00:40:00.000 mean we tested you know it
00:40:03.440 it violated
00:40:05.040 a lot of what we thought was impossible
00:40:06.880 to violate i mean one of the first laws
00:40:09.680 of thermodynamics i mean essentially any
00:40:12.400 machine any device that operates always
00:40:14.480 makes extra heat
00:40:16.320 nothing works at 100 efficient
00:40:18.880 even the headphones you're wearing
00:40:20.800 anything that takes power some of that
00:40:23.119 power is going to be con converted to
00:40:24.880 heat and it's just wasted
00:40:27.440 this didn't i mean we looked at back
00:40:29.359 then we had infrared cameras they're
00:40:31.280 different today but back then you had to
00:40:32.960 pour liquid nitrogen
00:40:34.640 into the camera to cool the sensor down
00:40:37.440 and um
00:40:38.640 and get these infrared images you've
00:40:40.320 seen
00:40:41.280 but it never got no matter what the load
00:40:43.680 was on the reactor it never got above
00:40:46.880 the ambient temperature which is
00:40:48.640 impossible i mean you're you know
00:40:52.079 pulling out huge amounts of power and
00:40:54.800 nothing ever gets warm
00:40:57.680 we tried measuring magnetic fields and
00:40:59.599 there was was nothing there so we
00:41:01.599 started playing around with the
00:41:04.000 emission from the emitters the gravity
00:41:05.920 wave itself
00:41:07.280 and saw what we could do with it and how
00:41:10.160 it was focused so we really spent all
00:41:12.800 our time
00:41:14.400 just trying to see
00:41:16.160 what the stuff can do and what we can
00:41:18.560 control so you were seeing what it could
00:41:20.800 do but you couldn't ever figure out how
00:41:22.400 it was doing it
00:41:24.319 no not really i mean we really we really
00:41:27.200 could only use a or come up with a best
00:41:29.359 guess and
00:41:31.520 now i can't say we really
00:41:34.560 that i could absolutely state for
00:41:36.480 certainly or certainty how anything
00:41:39.119 actually worked
00:41:40.720 now
00:41:41.920 how do did you know at all how they were
00:41:44.800 piloting it because some they were doing
00:41:47.839 some tests where they're having these
00:41:50.079 things
00:41:50.960 fly around in the sky
00:41:53.040 and this is
00:41:54.319 what gets us deeper into your story
00:41:56.960 right um
00:42:00.880 i was out there for uh
00:42:03.119 one test
00:42:04.720 um
00:42:05.520 right in fact i was in with barry in the
00:42:08.319 lab and dennis came in and said uh we're
00:42:11.599 about to run the test why don't you guys
00:42:13.200 come out or i think he said barry why
00:42:15.599 don't you come out here and bring bob
00:42:18.000 with you uh we went out there and
00:42:21.119 the craft was already outside the hangar
00:42:24.079 and was just preparing to lift off now
00:42:27.440 they were in communication with somebody
00:42:29.440 in the craft so there's a person in the
00:42:31.760 crowd yeah there was
00:42:33.599 certainly a person in there now it's not
00:42:35.920 a comfortable place to be in because
00:42:37.599 it's small so the guy has to be sitting
00:42:39.760 on the floor in the middle uh my best
00:42:42.160 guess and this is the same specific
00:42:44.079 craft that you heard that was because
00:42:45.440 you were that was the only craft that
00:42:46.640 you were the only one that i i touched
00:42:48.640 and worked on um
00:42:50.960 and it it quietly lifted off the ground
00:42:53.520 which was incredibly impressive to see
00:42:56.319 quietly or silently
00:42:58.640 what's
00:42:59.440 well quietly because it
00:43:01.920 didn't make sense
00:43:03.200 it produced um
00:43:05.680 a little corona discharge from the
00:43:07.440 bottom a corona discharge is kind of a
00:43:09.359 high voltage brush little bluish glow
00:43:11.920 discharge as it was lifting off the
00:43:13.760 ground you can hear a slight hiss sound
00:43:16.000 now as soon as it cleared the ground by
00:43:17.520 about five or ten feet
00:43:19.280 maybe even less than that the hissing
00:43:21.280 stopped and the blue gold disappeared so
00:43:24.640 it lifted off quietly and then it
00:43:26.640 hovered silently if you want to be
00:43:28.480 specific
00:43:29.599 wow so then what kind of maneuvers was
00:43:32.480 it doing
00:43:33.520 it took uh for that particular time it
00:43:35.760 took off moved a little around around to
00:43:38.079 the left and right and then sat back
00:43:39.760 down
00:43:40.560 the um
00:43:42.480 the craft itself
00:43:44.720 um
00:43:46.480 they communicated with it with a reg
00:43:48.800 because i saw the guy talking
00:43:52.319 in a regular vhf radio
00:43:54.880 to the person in the craft and i even
00:43:57.520 saw the frequency that was on the
00:43:59.839 the frequency counter of the uh
00:44:02.079 communication the transceiver there
00:44:04.240 um
00:44:05.280 but what's weird is
00:44:07.119 he shouldn't be able to communicate
00:44:09.520 with the craft with a radio the radio
00:44:13.280 the radio wave should bend around the
00:44:14.880 craft i mean it shouldn't be possible
00:44:17.520 every single thing about these the craft
00:44:20.560 and the way they operated
00:44:22.720 didn't make any sense to us i mean
00:44:25.040 that's something we talked about for a
00:44:26.800 while after why should the frequency
00:44:28.640 bend around the craft
00:44:30.160 well
00:44:31.440 you really have to look at the way the
00:44:32.960 gravity wave comes out of the craft
00:44:35.040 there's a the reactors in the center and
00:44:37.440 there's a waveguide that goes up to the
00:44:39.520 top there's actually a small appendage
00:44:41.280 that sticks out at the top of the craft
00:44:43.200 and it produces a heart-shaped
00:44:44.800 gravitational distortion around the
00:44:46.480 craft now if the craft is sitting in the
00:44:49.200 air and you walk underneath it and look
00:44:52.000 up
00:44:53.040 you actually cannot see the craft the
00:44:56.160 light bends around it your bending
00:44:58.560 gravity bends light it bends radio waves
00:45:01.920 it's um
00:45:03.520 it it shouldn't be possible to
00:45:06.079 communicate with a craft that has an
00:45:07.920 envelope around it that's distorting all
00:45:10.400 forms of energy
00:45:11.839 but
00:45:13.119 they were apparently in contact with it
00:45:15.040 somehow or another through some
00:45:17.359 unexplained way that they don't bother
00:45:19.359 explaining to you
00:45:21.119 so this thing gets up it just does some
00:45:22.640 very simple maneuvers left right left
00:45:24.480 right goes down
00:45:26.160 um and
00:45:27.520 did they discuss this with you i mean
00:45:29.280 they said they wanted you to see it no
00:45:30.640 they they just wanted no they they
00:45:32.800 didn't discuss anything with me it said
00:45:35.040 it sat down we looked around for a bit
00:45:37.119 and barry said let's go back we went
00:45:38.720 back in the lab all we got to do is see
00:45:40.640 it
00:45:41.280 um
00:45:42.720 fast forward
00:45:45.520 to some months later
00:45:47.599 i did have the test flight schedule of
00:45:49.839 the craft now they had times they had
00:45:51.839 designated high performance tests this
00:45:54.800 obviously wasn't one
00:45:56.480 that was a high performance test the
00:45:59.280 high performance test went goes above
00:46:02.000 the mountain range and they do much more
00:46:04.319 radical moves with the thing look this
00:46:05.760 is a prized item and they're not doing
00:46:09.359 anything like taking it out of the
00:46:10.480 atmosphere or flying around to other
00:46:12.079 countries or anything like that
00:46:13.839 they just play with this thing right
00:46:15.280 over the test site
00:46:17.119 but they were doing some radical moves
00:46:19.040 with it
00:46:19.920 and since i had the test flight schedule
00:46:22.160 statistically
00:46:25.119 the
00:46:26.160 amount of traffic and the surrounding
00:46:28.000 areas on the highway was lowest on
00:46:30.640 wednesdays and that's why
00:46:32.640 dennis told us that
00:46:34.480 all the test flights occurred only on
00:46:36.720 wednesdays because it'd be the least
00:46:39.200 chance that anyone would see what's
00:46:40.640 going on
00:46:41.760 and this was before the the government
00:46:44.160 had expanded the forbidden territory
00:46:47.119 around area 51 and papoose lake and all
00:46:50.079 that stuff right
00:46:51.680 yeah i think that occurred
00:46:53.839 after my story came out then people
00:46:56.160 started going up on the mountaintops and
00:46:58.319 trying to look down into there and they
00:47:00.560 kind of freaked out and then did the
00:47:02.079 land grab and pushed everybody back but
00:47:04.880 yeah that i think all that occurred long
00:47:07.200 after
00:47:08.560 i'm sorry that i came out
00:47:10.800 so
00:47:11.760 you're working there and while you're
00:47:13.839 working there you're under this crazy
00:47:15.280 schedule
00:47:16.640 forgive me for explaining your story but
00:47:19.359 you
00:47:20.160 uh would get these phone calls you would
00:47:22.240 have to go to the to the airport at 11
00:47:26.319 p.m
00:47:27.280 and your wife started thinking that you
00:47:29.119 were having an affair
00:47:31.599 yeah apparently so
00:47:33.359 um now i did give my permission to have
00:47:36.400 you know as as part of the
00:47:38.400 you know security clearance process um i
00:47:41.760 i gave written permission to have the
00:47:43.839 phones monitored and things of that sort
00:47:45.680 so they weren't doing any covert stuff
00:47:47.599 they um
00:47:49.280 you know with any queue clearance or
00:47:51.520 which is civilian top secret clearance
00:47:53.839 or military top secret clearance they go
00:47:55.920 talk to friends and
00:47:57.599 you know
00:47:58.640 place places you've been make sure
00:48:00.000 you're not connected to foreign
00:48:01.040 countries but you know monitoring your
00:48:03.119 phone is nothing unusual
00:48:04.960 however
00:48:06.400 they
00:48:07.440 insisted that
00:48:08.880 you know you don't even talk
00:48:10.720 to your loved one to your partner to
00:48:12.240 your wife whatever about what's going on
00:48:14.720 so she was essentially in the dark
00:48:17.040 and didn't know the phone was being
00:48:18.480 monitored
00:48:19.599 well
00:48:21.280 part of the security clearance
00:48:23.839 is that not only do you not have any
00:48:25.839 connections to foreign countries and
00:48:27.359 aren't a maniac but you have to have a
00:48:29.359 stable home life too
00:48:31.280 well she started having an affair with a
00:48:33.520 flight instructor
00:48:35.040 now they were monitoring this on the
00:48:37.119 phone and they knew it and i didn't
00:48:39.440 so they stopped me
00:48:41.280 coming in and their attitude at the time
00:48:44.000 was
00:48:45.599 we need to see how this is going to play
00:48:47.119 out and if lazar is going to get a
00:48:49.520 little weird or anything so
00:48:51.599 let's just
00:48:52.880 you know hold him off from coming in
00:48:55.599 and
00:48:56.720 you know see what happens and they
00:48:58.319 explain this to you what was happening
00:49:00.480 well after the fact yeah because time
00:49:02.880 kind of went on
00:49:04.319 and
00:49:05.200 there were guys that were following me
00:49:06.880 around and i started getting a little
00:49:09.040 concerned going well
00:49:10.800 ted are they
00:49:12.480 booting me out of the project and if so
00:49:16.160 they're not just going to let me hang
00:49:17.680 out at home and go get a new job knowing
00:49:19.920 what i know
00:49:21.119 so
00:49:22.319 as time went on i started getting a
00:49:24.160 little concerned and
00:49:26.079 i took my closest friends and just kind
00:49:28.240 of got together and i said hey
00:49:30.720 remember that job i told you about
00:49:33.200 this is what's going on
00:49:35.119 and uh like you don't need to take my
00:49:37.440 word for it
00:49:38.640 on wednesday night we need to all go out
00:49:40.960 here i want to show you what's going on
00:49:42.640 so i took everybody and we went out to
00:49:45.920 um remember since i had the test flight
00:49:48.000 schedule and went outside the base
00:49:51.599 out into the desert and so everybody
00:49:53.680 could see you know one of the high
00:49:55.119 performance tests
00:49:56.640 and you know it left quite an imprint on
00:49:59.280 everybody so they knew i wasn't and
00:50:01.040 there's videos of these tests right yeah
00:50:03.280 but remember this is in the
00:50:05.200 it's in in the dark in the 80s with a
00:50:07.359 big monster-sized camcorder and you got
00:50:09.520 you know a bright light jumping around
00:50:11.680 but uh yeah i mean we did video of it
00:50:14.160 but there's no
00:50:15.520 by today's standards it's but is your
00:50:17.599 video specifically available the video
00:50:19.680 that you took
00:50:20.800 yeah well george knapp has it it's is it
00:50:24.319 i have no idea jeremy yeah i show clips
00:50:26.720 of it in my film it's it's online and
00:50:28.559 someone did a deep analysis of it uh it
00:50:30.880 was interesting uh to take a look at how
00:50:33.280 well this microphone up to your face
00:50:34.720 about a fist from your face all right
00:50:36.559 um you know to see how his video looks
00:50:39.119 now but as far as video evidence i mean
00:50:41.760 we are talking 80s camp was the most
00:50:43.839 important thing is the human story here
00:50:45.839 everybody that he took up there on three
00:50:48.079 separate occasions they don't all like
00:50:50.000 each other they don't all talk they all
00:50:52.400 agree on one thing they saw something
00:50:54.720 that night at the exact point in time
00:50:56.720 and space that babazar said and remember
00:50:58.480 this is 17 15 17 miles south of air 51.
00:51:01.839 no one even knew really about air 51
00:51:03.920 we're talking papoose lake and they all
00:51:05.920 agree they saw something that night they
00:51:07.920 had never seen before and they've never
00:51:09.760 seen since right when he said it so
00:51:11.760 that's one of like the six things where
00:51:13.440 i'm like how did he know you can dismiss
00:51:15.760 him i i tried to dismiss it but some
00:51:18.240 things we can't get around and and
00:51:19.760 there's about five or six of them how
00:51:21.760 did he know about this if jamie wants to
00:51:23.200 find that video right now what would he
00:51:24.480 look under
00:51:25.760 bob lazar ufo
00:51:28.400 s for
00:51:30.160 area 51 just kind of like that uh so
00:51:32.400 it's like this s4 ufo video bob lazar
00:51:35.520 and a guy does an analysis but you're
00:51:37.680 not analyzing these 80s videos right he
00:51:41.520 from the very beginning bob never said i
00:51:43.839 have proof of my story and i'm going to
00:51:45.599 tell the world he said at the very
00:51:47.359 beginning i cannot prove my story that's
00:51:50.079 not why i'm telling this george knapp
00:51:52.400 convinced him to tell people
00:51:54.720 and he lived through it and i i didn't
00:51:56.000 believe it either until i i talked with
00:51:58.000 george
00:51:59.040 okay so you
00:52:00.640 you filmed these
00:52:02.960 this test flight one test flight and
00:52:04.960 then you get caught
00:52:06.800 actually it was i think the third time
00:52:09.200 because it
00:52:10.720 we went out there the first time
00:52:13.520 everybody saw it everybody was amazed
00:52:15.680 because it did some radical maneuvers
00:52:17.920 and um you know everybody had a lot of
00:52:20.640 maneuvers that i've seen i've seen the
00:52:22.000 video it doesn't i don't think there's
00:52:24.400 something we have now that does that no
00:52:26.640 in terms of like a human piloted craft
00:52:29.680 i mean i don't know obviously with the
00:52:31.359 government no it's it's impossible
00:52:32.960 nothing can move like that and remember
00:52:35.040 we didn't start filming from the very
00:52:36.880 beginning
00:52:37.920 you know
00:52:39.040 we were waiting for something you know
00:52:40.640 to happen the craft took off and then
00:52:42.319 came flying at us stopped you know
00:52:44.400 turned it a right angle flew back and
00:52:46.160 then you know after it did some you know
00:52:48.000 amazing stuff
00:52:49.359 to get the camera and then we started
00:52:51.280 filming so it doesn't have all of it on
00:52:53.520 there it just has some the way i
00:52:55.200 describe it to my friends and they said
00:52:56.480 what does it look like i said take a
00:52:58.000 laser pointer and then have a wall and
00:53:00.319 then move it around the wall like you
00:53:02.240 know how it moves around the wall it
00:53:03.440 doesn't seem like it has anything to do
00:53:04.960 with inertia or physics or it's not
00:53:07.760 impeded in any way by the atmosphere
00:53:09.920 yeah that's what it looks like you're
00:53:11.200 essentially separated from reality as
00:53:14.079 crazy as that sounds with it being in in
00:53:17.200 case it's an own gravitational envelope
00:53:20.400 inertia is not going to affect it and
00:53:22.640 you know this is
00:53:25.280 this is how some of those recent
00:53:26.720 sightings of commander david fravor i'm
00:53:28.880 sure you've heard of the
00:53:30.400 ufo i mean he describes exactly
00:53:33.440 that the thing operates exactly the way
00:53:35.280 i was describing that's why
00:53:37.520 he was interested to talk to me um but
00:53:40.960 we saw this
00:53:42.559 and
00:53:43.680 you know on the way home it's like hey
00:53:45.440 we got away with it we should try it
00:53:46.880 again the next test flight date so this
00:53:49.760 became a thing to do
00:53:51.520 and i think it was on
00:53:52.960 the third time
00:53:54.559 that we got caught i mean we started
00:53:57.440 becoming a little careless i think we
00:53:59.119 took a motor home out there
00:54:01.040 you know i mean it was like the
00:54:02.559 stupidest thing you could possibly start
00:54:04.720 tailgating yeah it was ridiculous and um
00:54:07.760 again you're in your 20s yeah and you
00:54:10.400 know what was funny was um
00:54:13.119 we went out there and
00:54:15.200 my friend gene huff and i were leaning
00:54:17.520 on the front of a vehicle
00:54:19.440 and
00:54:21.040 just for some reason we just started
00:54:23.040 talking [ __ ] like uh well i hope they
00:54:26.960 realize that uh
00:54:29.440 i don't remember what we were saying but
00:54:31.280 you know that
00:54:33.200 something about attacking the base or
00:54:34.880 something along those lines and stealing
00:54:37.119 the craft or
00:54:38.480 something like that
00:54:40.079 and um
00:54:41.280 then about 20 feet in front of us we see
00:54:43.440 a little green light
00:54:45.440 fall on the ground and roll to us
00:54:47.920 and unbeknownst to us now it's pitch
00:54:50.000 black you can't see your hand in front
00:54:51.359 of your face there were a bunch of
00:54:52.640 guards standing right out there and they
00:54:54.880 had a night vision scope where they were
00:54:56.880 like from here to the wall looking at us
00:54:59.119 listening to us and the guy dropped it
00:55:00.720 and the scope rolled over to us and you
00:55:02.400 could see the green screen
00:55:04.319 you know we turn the lights on and all
00:55:06.400 these guys are there so
00:55:08.240 it was uh whoa yeah yeah so we did
00:55:10.960 incredibly stupid stuff and got caught
00:55:12.800 as we should have because so when they
00:55:14.480 catch you and they bring you in then
00:55:15.920 what happens well i went in for
00:55:17.440 debriefing
00:55:19.040 the following day i went to indian
00:55:21.119 springs air force base which is kind of
00:55:23.119 a defunct
00:55:24.880 base that they used to use at the
00:55:26.720 nuclear test site
00:55:28.319 and this is when they brought out
00:55:31.200 um
00:55:32.400 the transcript of the phone call
00:55:34.559 with my wife
00:55:36.559 and you know they sat me down and we
00:55:38.880 said you know when we meant to keep the
00:55:40.640 secret we meant you can't tell your
00:55:43.040 friends right you know and it just being
00:55:45.280 sarcastic and trying to mm-hmm um and
00:55:48.000 then they got real serious
00:55:50.079 uh but this is where they
00:55:52.480 you know took the transcript out and
00:55:54.000 were reading me what uh
00:55:56.400 my wife
00:55:58.000 and
00:55:59.119 you know our friend were talking about
00:56:01.200 and uh
00:56:03.440 it was a hard time so what happens from
00:56:05.520 there
00:56:08.079 what do they do with you why don't they
00:56:09.440 arrest you
00:56:10.480 i don't i don't know i don't know why
00:56:13.119 i'm not sure they exactly they knew what
00:56:15.359 to do but they did let me go
00:56:18.160 that night and i went home
00:56:20.559 and that this is kind of when the most
00:56:22.640 stressful part started because you're
00:56:24.559 realizing you're being monitored
00:56:26.640 yeah now i know not only am i being
00:56:28.720 monitored but now i know i'm in trouble
00:56:31.119 and uh it wasn't a short time after that
00:56:33.839 that i contacted you know at that time
00:56:36.400 the
00:56:37.119 only investigative reporter i had heard
00:56:39.200 of in las vegas was george knapp
00:56:41.599 and um you know told him some of the
00:56:43.839 story because i had no idea what the
00:56:45.440 hell was going to happen at that point
00:56:47.280 so george knapp
00:56:49.200 tries to
00:56:50.880 dissect your story tries to find holes
00:56:52.960 in it
00:56:53.920 tells it puts it online and makes
00:56:56.160 everybody aware of it and that's how i
00:56:57.440 found out about it yeah to make a long
00:56:59.599 story short
00:57:01.119 what happens yeah to really make a long
00:57:02.960 story short what happens from there on i
00:57:05.119 mean do they contact you and say hey bob
00:57:07.520 it's probably a good idea if you shut up
00:57:12.079 how
00:57:13.359 did they try to label you as crazy was
00:57:15.440 there
00:57:17.680 there were boy there were a lot of
00:57:19.119 things that happened at you know between
00:57:22.319 that point um i'm leaving out a lot of
00:57:24.839 stuff to fill in the story
00:57:28.559 we'd have to go back to los alamos and
00:57:30.880 and
00:57:33.040 well i really don't want to talk about
00:57:34.480 that the um
00:57:37.440 top secret weapons
00:57:39.040 stuff that you were working on
00:57:41.040 no i'm talking about the 115.
00:57:43.359 um
00:57:46.240 well i don't know i have to think about
00:57:47.599 how i'd
00:57:49.440 what is the problem
00:57:52.839 i don't want to get myself into more
00:57:55.280 trouble by admitting something so
00:57:57.440 um i just have to dance around a couple
00:57:59.839 he was created just during the filming
00:58:01.680 of the movie people thought the movie's
00:58:03.599 great by the way thanks joe and uh it's
00:58:05.359 on netflix right now if anybody wants to
00:58:07.359 check it out and if you're one of those
00:58:08.799 people like me
00:58:10.160 who um you know i've always
00:58:12.640 loved the idea of ufos i became
00:58:15.119 extremely weary talking to people who
00:58:17.680 are ufo believers and ufo fanatics
00:58:19.920 because there's so many of them that are
00:58:21.119 full of [ __ ] and not just full of [ __ ]
00:58:23.119 they're they're childishly delirious
00:58:26.720 like the way they talk about things i
00:58:28.720 mean there's so many people that are
00:58:30.400 that i'm in contact they they reach me
00:58:33.040 in the night and they explain to me what
00:58:34.880 we're doing to the ocean is wrong and
00:58:37.280 like you're like okay this is one of the
00:58:39.119 reasons i didn't want to do the show
00:58:44.000 well it's i mean it's no joke we've had
00:58:46.559 people literally camp out on our front
00:58:48.400 lawn and uh
00:58:50.480 you know
00:58:51.920 in some ways i can relate to some of
00:58:53.680 these people you know maybe some of them
00:58:55.359 did really have some kind of experience
00:58:57.280 or saw something and all their friends
00:58:59.280 think they're crazy but hey now there's
00:59:01.119 this guy i heard on the radio
00:59:03.280 and uh at least he knows i'm not full of
00:59:06.000 [ __ ] so i gotta talk to him and so most
00:59:08.960 of the
00:59:09.760 correspondents i get are people trying
00:59:11.520 to get a hold of me going bob you you
00:59:13.440 gotta listen to me i'm i'm coming to
00:59:15.200 talk to you i'm you know i'm driving
00:59:16.960 from oklahoma or whatever and and and
00:59:20.000 but some of them are just [ __ ] bad
00:59:22.240 [ __ ] crazy yeah they're frightening
00:59:24.480 there's a lot of schizophrenics that are
00:59:26.160 involved in the conspiracy world so
00:59:29.040 there's a lot of people that have real
00:59:30.319 issues joe
00:59:31.520 it would be a disservice to your
00:59:33.200 audience to not say that
00:59:36.000 we have to look at what's going on now
00:59:37.760 and understand i've heard
00:59:39.200 on your show a bunch of stuff about
00:59:40.720 what's going on now and to not really
00:59:43.119 understand what's going on now you can't
00:59:45.920 see bob's story in the correct light
00:59:48.319 after 30 years and at some point we
00:59:50.319 should just touch upon that
00:59:52.640 um the the biggest being that things
00:59:55.119 like the tic tac ufo case that came out
00:59:57.920 i've heard people even on the show say
00:59:59.920 oh there's a glitch in the radar
01:00:01.839 that's a data poor perspective you just
01:00:04.480 don't know yet what's really going on
01:00:06.240 commander fravor i was able to get the
01:00:08.160 interview with him to talk with him way
01:00:09.680 before it became public i got that from
01:00:12.559 him he saw it other pilots saw it this
01:00:15.920 is a big thing that's going on right now
01:00:18.480 they had more sightings on the east
01:00:20.400 coast recently cubes with spherical
01:00:23.200 auras these are not aerodynamic and
01:00:24.720 these are the people we trust to defend
01:00:26.160 us on 911 commander favor protected los
01:00:28.720 angeles and 911. so we trust them but
01:00:31.280 they're not trained observers
01:00:33.280 radar
01:00:34.400 individuals see these things and the big
01:00:36.160 the big one just to throw down so we can
01:00:37.920 consider a story a little differently
01:00:39.200 there's more depth to it the big one is
01:00:41.599 the united states government has
01:00:43.040 admitted that they have been
01:00:44.559 continuously studying the ufo phenomenon
01:00:47.359 that program was called a tip advanced
01:00:50.400 error or sorry
01:00:52.160 was called awsap that that's the
01:00:54.880 mother program george knapp got that out
01:00:57.119 they they announced through the new york
01:00:58.559 times about a tip
01:01:00.480 but awesome these acronyms asap advanced
01:01:02.960 aerospace weapon systems applications
01:01:04.559 program who cares
01:01:06.000 that was the mother program so they've
01:01:07.760 admitted we didn't stop studying ufos in
01:01:09.520 1969 with project blue book we don't
01:01:11.760 think it's crazy we actually want to
01:01:13.520 reverse engineer the technology that's
01:01:15.200 why on your other show you said what's
01:01:16.960 this aav thing it's like they're making
01:01:18.960 up another ufo name well hold on there's
01:01:20.640 a reason because in the documents the
01:01:23.200 the dia documents that george knapp
01:01:25.040 released that everybody said was fake
01:01:26.720 till now they know is real
01:01:28.400 they call them aavs which is advanced
01:01:32.079 aerospace vehicles people are getting
01:01:34.400 the acronyms wrong so the reason for the
01:01:36.480 terminology change is so that we can
01:01:38.880 mimic what we're reading in the dia
01:01:40.400 documents people can look for that now
01:01:42.640 so they changed the names to get people
01:01:44.799 away from ufo or uap even like hillary
01:01:47.040 clinton said on air right so what are
01:01:49.760 you talking about hillary clinton
01:01:51.359 hillary clinton
01:01:52.640 informed the public on jimmy kimmel oh
01:01:55.680 jimmy we don't call them ufos anymore we
01:01:58.240 call them uaps unidentified aerial
01:02:00.880 phenomenon
01:02:02.000 right so she kind of was giving their
01:02:03.839 the clintons are very into the ufo topic
01:02:06.160 senator reid you know he he's done a lot
01:02:08.480 for the for the subject the study of it
01:02:10.640 right
01:02:11.440 so she informed the public so they could
01:02:13.280 look for the right term so these terms
01:02:15.200 are important because the dia in those
01:02:17.760 documents they've been calling them aavs
01:02:20.640 for quite some time now and they change
01:02:22.400 the name to anomalous no that that's
01:02:25.359 kind of a misnomer
01:02:26.960 so
01:02:27.920 they always mess around with things but
01:02:29.920 it's actually advanced right but when
01:02:32.079 they're describing it in the news they
01:02:33.599 were calling an anomalous space vehicle
01:02:35.760 totally and that's cool they were also
01:02:37.359 saying anomalous aerospace threats aat
01:02:40.880 right because they want the sense of a
01:02:42.160 threat right so my point is all of if
01:02:45.280 people don't know this now and they
01:02:46.960 think this stuff is is fantasy this this
01:02:48.960 part of it that we're studying it that
01:02:50.480 we take it seriously we're spending
01:02:51.920 money on it and that we're getting great
01:02:54.079 data from from visual pilots to to radar
01:02:56.720 that's why we know it's aerospace they
01:02:58.240 dropped from 80 000 feet but guess what
01:03:00.480 that's the top scope of the spy 1 radar
01:03:03.280 is 80 000 feet so the radar system they
01:03:05.839 were using it was coming from above that
01:03:08.079 so my point is this
01:03:10.160 if you don't understand that this is
01:03:12.319 happening you're just behind the curve
01:03:14.640 because you don't have the information
01:03:16.559 because of the stigma that you're
01:03:18.240 talking about i saw you get totally
01:03:20.160 upset with the ufo topic i met you first
01:03:22.480 when you're totally upset with the ufo
01:03:24.000 topic it's the people when
01:03:26.480 when when you're doing your
01:03:28.160 i'm sorry man when you're when you're
01:03:29.520 doing your show you know the joe organ
01:03:31.680 questions everything
01:03:33.039 i could see
01:03:34.240 how
01:03:35.280 how frustrating is trust me i have been
01:03:37.119 frustrated to hell luckily my mentors
01:03:39.119 george knapp and he's taught me the pit
01:03:40.720 bull pitfalls as i went through it my
01:03:43.280 whole point in this rant right here
01:03:45.599 is just that we have to now look at
01:03:47.440 bob's story but knowing the facts
01:03:50.720 not someone saying it's a bird it's a
01:03:52.400 plane it's a glitch
01:03:54.000 they're not and so if you don't know
01:03:56.079 that you just don't have the information
01:03:57.680 yet not just that knowing the facts as
01:03:59.280 we know him in 2019 not in 1988
01:04:02.079 absolutely and so what has he said
01:04:05.680 that has come true he's totally
01:04:07.119 unimpressed with it right what has he
01:04:08.880 said this come true so i was like bob
01:04:10.880 they've announced gravity as a wave you
01:04:13.520 were right man you're vindicated and he
01:04:15.599 looks at me and he's like well if you
01:04:17.119 think about it jeremy i had like a 50 50
01:04:19.280 chance he was not very impressed right
01:04:22.640 when did they announce gravity as a wave
01:04:24.960 so they detected in a sense they
01:04:26.880 detected gravity waves who were who was
01:04:29.280 they
01:04:30.480 you might know more there's two black
01:04:32.000 holes that were colliding and that's how
01:04:33.440 they were able to detect yeah somebody
01:04:35.440 bill i don't know which group it was or
01:04:37.280 what part of the government that's what
01:04:39.119 google's for yeah would it but they um
01:04:42.720 you know built a gigantic gravity wave
01:04:44.559 detector and pretty much
01:04:47.119 detected that there are such things as
01:04:50.480 first observation of gravitational waves
01:04:53.599 it says it was in 2016.
01:04:56.480 okay the first observation of
01:04:57.920 gravitational waves was made on 14th of
01:05:00.079 september 2015 right as announced by the
01:05:02.799 ligo and virgo collaborators on the 11th
01:05:06.319 of february 2016 previously
01:05:08.799 gravitational waves had only been
01:05:10.319 inferred indirectly via their effect on
01:05:13.039 the timing of pulsars in binary star
01:05:16.000 systems
01:05:18.640 the waveform connected by both
01:05:21.359 ligo ligo observatories match the
01:05:24.559 predictions of general relativity for
01:05:27.280 gravity for a gravitational wave
01:05:32.079 emanating from the inward sp i'm trying
01:05:34.880 to get this from the inward spiral and
01:05:37.280 merger of a pair of black holes around
01:05:39.920 36 and 29 solar masses and the
01:05:42.400 subsequent
01:05:43.520 ring down
01:05:44.799 of the single resulting black hole
01:05:47.599 well that i mean
01:05:49.039 yeah it's not he was in the 80s the
01:05:51.200 predominant theory was gravity is
01:05:53.200 produced by gravitons okay you know part
01:05:55.839 of theoretic theoretical particles but
01:05:58.720 um they're not they're waves they're not
01:06:00.960 particles and that's so the thought is
01:06:03.200 that the way we experience gravity it's
01:06:05.680 based on mass which is why the moon
01:06:08.640 which is
01:06:09.680 roughly one quarter the size of the
01:06:11.440 earth has one sixth of the earth's
01:06:13.119 gravity so there's some sort of a
01:06:14.319 computation you can make based on mass
01:06:16.079 right and and remember
01:06:18.640 we can observe
01:06:20.160 the effects of gravity but we have no
01:06:22.640 idea what it is all we can do is observe
01:06:25.760 it and we can't make it the only way you
01:06:27.680 can make gravity is just put more mass
01:06:29.920 together and it's just a product of
01:06:31.839 gravity but if you can make a if you
01:06:34.079 have a machine that makes gravity
01:06:37.039 you can pretty much do anything you can
01:06:39.119 affect time you can have force fields
01:06:42.000 all that stuff that's in science fiction
01:06:44.079 becomes reality if you have a machine
01:06:47.119 that can make gravity and what we worked
01:06:49.440 on in the desert was a machine that
01:06:51.920 makes gravity i love your analogy of
01:06:54.400 dropping off a small nuclear reactor to
01:06:57.200 the victorian era i love that that
01:06:59.599 analogy because back then that was
01:07:02.480 impossible that was magic
01:07:04.960 what you're talking about here the fact
01:07:07.119 that they just discovered this four
01:07:09.280 years ago that this is a wave when we're
01:07:12.640 as much as we know and as impressed as
01:07:14.480 we are as we should be with how much
01:07:17.039 more
01:07:17.920 technologically advanced we are than
01:07:19.599 every other creature on this planet
01:07:21.200 we're still in many ways in the
01:07:22.960 adolescence of technological innovation
01:07:25.280 absolutely
01:07:26.480 absolutely if even adolescence and when
01:07:30.000 you're talking about this binary star
01:07:32.880 system zeta reticuli and who knows how
01:07:36.319 much longer these things have been
01:07:37.839 around than us who knows what their
01:07:40.079 evolutionary cycle's been who knows what
01:07:43.200 i mean we might be talking about
01:07:44.240 something that's a million years more
01:07:45.359 advanced than us
01:07:46.720 yeah yeah it could easily be now i'm not
01:07:49.680 in
01:07:50.720 believe it or not i'm not into ufos i
01:07:52.720 don't follow stories or you know even
01:07:55.359 after your experiences no i'm fascinated
01:07:57.920 with the technology and i i it really it
01:08:00.559 irks me like every night i go to sleep
01:08:02.640 that you know i don't
01:08:05.920 that it was my own doing essentially
01:08:08.559 that
01:08:09.359 that prevented me from continuing on in
01:08:11.280 the in the project i mean it's the
01:08:13.920 that to be on that cutting edge of
01:08:15.440 technology is so alluring to me right
01:08:18.640 but
01:08:20.399 you know by the same token i don't
01:08:22.479 really care that there's aliens or where
01:08:24.479 they come from i mean the prize is the
01:08:26.560 technology and that's what i'm
01:08:27.839 fascinated by but so i don't listen to
01:08:29.839 ufo stories and that sort of thing but
01:08:31.600 george knapp is um
01:08:33.600 i mean he's the guy that has the context
01:08:36.399 and tries to thread everything together
01:08:38.560 and
01:08:39.520 what he recently told me is he found
01:08:42.319 i don't know is either documentation or
01:08:44.238 people that he spoke to it's at this the
01:08:46.479 existence of this project the project
01:08:48.238 that i was on it's something that they
01:08:52.479 seem to take out every eight or ten
01:08:54.399 years so that's a very specific memo and
01:08:57.120 this is actually i this is the first
01:08:59.040 time i'll be very clear with people
01:09:00.479 about it it's a big topic of
01:09:01.759 conversation right now it's called the
01:09:03.759 wilson memo
01:09:05.198 you can look it up
01:09:06.479 admiral wilson met with a scientist
01:09:09.120 who's actually was featured in one of my
01:09:10.719 films
01:09:11.759 everybody has been debating whether or
01:09:13.600 not this document
01:09:15.600 of a conversation
01:09:17.520 with a with a sitting admiral at the
01:09:19.198 time is a real
01:09:20.799 document it's an actual conversation
01:09:22.640 that happened and this document is real
01:09:24.000 everybody wants to know the world is
01:09:25.120 going crazy right now in the ufo world
01:09:27.359 i'll tell you straight up right now
01:09:29.439 i'm in the position to know and it is a
01:09:31.920 real document
01:09:33.759 that it is real so the conversation you
01:09:36.158 read in that
01:09:37.600 that conversation was had i can't attest
01:09:39.679 to everything
01:09:40.479 you're not being very clear sure please
01:09:42.719 no problem
01:09:43.759 so there was a document that is
01:09:45.520 circulating right now that is really big
01:09:47.600 it's going around everywhere people are
01:09:49.040 asking what is this talking about it's
01:09:51.120 called the wilson memo is what how you
01:09:52.960 can find it online
01:09:54.640 the or the wilson leak there it is
01:09:56.800 jimmy's got it the wilson memorandum use
01:09:59.280 of human volunteers no no no no no
01:10:02.400 yeah so uh
01:10:04.880 admiral wilson meets with this scientist
01:10:07.520 and they have this discussion oddly
01:10:09.120 enough at special projects at egng and
01:10:11.760 if i remember the document is from 2001
01:10:14.000 i'm telling everybody right now it's
01:10:15.440 real and we'll see my history is pretty
01:10:17.840 good with like saying if something's
01:10:19.199 real or not right so here we go the
01:10:21.120 document comes out they meet at eg
01:10:23.199 special projects in 1989 they stumble
01:10:27.120 into a problem
01:10:28.640 this happens they put the technology
01:10:31.120 away and then they bring it back out and
01:10:33.440 see if material science has caught up
01:10:35.760 and if they can make any progress so
01:10:37.840 this document kind of talks about this
01:10:39.520 process the big thing i get from it and
01:10:41.679 a lot of it's vindicating to bob and one
01:10:43.920 of the things that's vindicating besides
01:10:45.360 the eg g thing
01:10:46.800 is that private industry so this guy's
01:10:49.679 an admiral and he says i found out about
01:10:52.719 your sap your special access program i
01:10:55.360 need to know about it and he's going to
01:10:57.920 a private part of industry
01:11:00.480 and he is denied access
01:11:02.719 and he says i you know i should be
01:11:04.400 running this program and they were able
01:11:06.800 to deny him access
01:11:08.960 so i think the takeaway here is check it
01:11:11.360 out i'm telling you that that is an
01:11:12.880 actual correct that is a leak now
01:11:15.280 everything said in that document i'm i
01:11:16.960 don't know what are you talking about
01:11:18.239 what what is said in that document
01:11:19.360 specifically it's it's a between a
01:11:21.120 scientist and an admiral that are
01:11:23.120 sitting and they're having a meeting and
01:11:25.360 they're talking about
01:11:26.960 the the search for the the ufo subject
01:11:29.440 the search to get special access program
01:11:31.920 access to all of these different things
01:11:34.400 like reverse engineering programs
01:11:37.199 so in this document they talk about it
01:11:40.000 uh i believe that
01:11:42.000 this document that the person that went
01:11:43.600 was employed by robert bigelow you know
01:11:45.360 one of the guys that has a couple of
01:11:46.480 orbiting satellites and all that stuff
01:11:48.239 who's the guy owned skinwalker ranch no
01:11:50.719 he's not he was the guy the walker okay
01:11:54.320 yeah he used to own it there's a new
01:11:55.760 owner and i i interview him for my other
01:11:58.159 film
01:11:59.040 but there's a new owner and you'll be
01:12:00.480 hearing a lot more about that soon
01:12:02.800 but uh like it'll just there's there's
01:12:04.719 stuff that you'll be hearing about
01:12:05.920 skinwalker ranching because there's a
01:12:07.120 new owner anyway the whole point of this
01:12:10.000 you know insertion here is just that
01:12:12.480 that document kind of validates a lot of
01:12:15.760 this idea bob just said that they make a
01:12:18.080 little progress then they can't go
01:12:20.000 anywhere they tuck it away and then they
01:12:22.159 bring it back out you know 10 years
01:12:24.000 later and start working on it
01:12:26.000 what is the limiting factor i think bob
01:12:27.679 should speak on this but it's the
01:12:29.199 material science
01:12:30.880 yeah it's really where physics is so i i
01:12:33.199 can i can see them doing that i mean i
01:12:35.440 didn't have any
01:12:36.880 uh
01:12:37.679 information on that but i think what you
01:12:40.159 know george uncovered is probably
01:12:41.840 accurate that uh you know we try and do
01:12:44.080 what we can and once we reach a
01:12:46.000 roadblock on we really can't figure it
01:12:48.400 out it's just friggin wait put the thing
01:12:51.600 away wait for science to catch up and
01:12:54.159 you know a decade later let's take the
01:12:55.920 project out again and see all right now
01:12:57.840 where can we go but there's got to be
01:12:59.679 someone who remains informed right oh
01:13:02.239 yeah you've got your scientists like you
01:13:04.480 and barry you got your people that you
01:13:06.480 compartmentalize you got these people
01:13:07.840 working on yeah there has to be some
01:13:09.280 people right that know everything you've
01:13:11.440 got security and then someone's going to
01:13:14.000 be on the outside saying hey we need
01:13:16.239 people to guard this building don't let
01:13:17.920 anybody in for ten years i think i think
01:13:19.840 a lot of that is private industry and i
01:13:22.000 think that's how they keep it yeah i
01:13:23.440 think that's how they literally because
01:13:24.960 the government is just so leaky i think
01:13:27.760 that's kind of what they're doing that's
01:13:29.280 what the document kind of proves you
01:13:30.880 just articulated that that um it is in
01:13:33.280 control private industry what private
01:13:35.040 industry
01:13:36.159 some aerospace company something i don't
01:13:38.080 know yeah they wouldn't they would the
01:13:39.199 guy with the admiral wouldn't name it in
01:13:40.880 the car right in the conversation right
01:13:43.040 so
01:13:43.920 they
01:13:44.880 still have these things supposedly
01:13:48.800 i would guess i mean i don't have any
01:13:50.560 information have you ever asked anyone
01:13:53.840 that has any inkling of any idea of
01:13:57.360 where they got them or how they got them
01:14:00.000 no but um
01:14:01.840 something must have been said to me um
01:14:05.199 from barry
01:14:06.800 and but i i it was just too long ago and
01:14:09.120 i i can't quite remember what was said
01:14:10.880 but it
01:14:11.920 it just left a seat in my mind i think
01:14:14.000 at least one of them was part of an
01:14:15.600 archaeological dig
01:14:18.159 so
01:14:19.280 it's old
01:14:20.719 something one at least one of them is
01:14:22.560 old i don't know if it was the one i
01:14:23.920 worked on but i remember
01:14:25.760 something to do with an archaeological
01:14:27.440 dig whoa so that's uh
01:14:30.320 that means it's not just old it's
01:14:31.679 ancient that'd be a great stephen
01:14:33.199 spielberg movie yeah right
01:14:35.040 [Laughter]
01:14:37.040 as all of it would yeah that took me out
01:14:38.960 when he said that for the first time
01:14:40.480 yeah that's a freak out right there just
01:14:42.640 a couple of dudes with some brushes
01:14:44.560 looking for a tyrannosaurus rex bone and
01:14:46.800 metal and when did they find it you know
01:14:49.040 that they have nine of them well and how
01:14:51.520 could we have not heard about that what
01:14:53.440 about the guys with the brushes how
01:14:55.280 could you uncover something like that
01:14:57.440 and joe's newspaper at home does i mean
01:14:59.840 they said it on that first day oh you
01:15:01.679 mean the roswell yeah yeah yeah you told
01:15:03.199 me yeah yeah i have a cover what is this
01:15:05.520 here james it's the document but i had
01:15:07.440 to do some digging to find it yes it's
01:15:09.280 just kind of
01:15:10.640 yeah so this is where they meet at egng
01:15:12.480 and this is admiral wilson and there's a
01:15:14.000 lot more coming out now i want to be
01:15:15.120 clear george didn't put this out he
01:15:17.360 didn't
01:15:18.400 leak this out to anybody this is i can
01:15:20.480 tell you how i recorded this this
01:15:22.159 conversation so this was an employee
01:15:24.400 of at the time robert bigelow and this
01:15:26.480 is in 2002 right do you remember when he
01:15:28.480 had that government contract called
01:15:30.000 awesap the world all knows about now and
01:15:32.000 he had nids that studied the ranch so
01:15:33.760 that 22 million everybody is saying it
01:15:35.600 was for atip um advanced aerospace
01:15:38.480 threat identification program
01:15:40.480 the 22 million dollars was for ossap
01:15:43.520 that was pushed through through congress
01:15:45.280 three congressmen right an astronaut it
01:15:48.159 was pushed through
01:15:49.520 and that's what that 22 million dollars
01:15:51.600 by the way they spend more money on
01:15:52.880 viagra every year than they do studying
01:15:54.400 ufos if it was just this program which i
01:15:56.239 think is funny but they probably make a
01:15:57.760 lot more money from fragrance they
01:15:59.040 probably do ufos well you never know how
01:16:01.120 it seeds into population but anyway this
01:16:03.440 program
01:16:04.480 uh this is what was the mother program
01:16:06.960 so it it got the 22 million and really
01:16:09.440 it was to study skinwalker ranch oddly
01:16:11.520 enough that 22 million all was inspired
01:16:14.480 by the phenomenon they were seeing at
01:16:15.679 skinwalker ranch because the scientists
01:16:18.320 they're seeing vehicles come through
01:16:20.560 like a space in the sky yeah we went
01:16:23.440 there i went through it yeah we
01:16:25.520 interviewed
01:16:27.120 a bunch of people that seemed full of
01:16:28.320 [ __ ] but a couple that didn't but it's
01:16:30.000 very very interesting totally any
01:16:32.080 there's but if you look i spent a lot of
01:16:33.920 time in the area i'm not talking about
01:16:35.520 those stories i'm saying there were
01:16:36.560 scientists hired by the government right
01:16:39.120 through bigelow to study the ranch
01:16:40.880 because they thought it was important
01:16:42.320 and you know whatever whatever the point
01:16:44.640 is that 22 million was to study that
01:16:46.719 then we have atip which is like an
01:16:48.480 auxiliary kind of program of military
01:16:50.719 settings like commander framers and that
01:16:52.159 sort of thing this document is just one
01:16:55.199 of those things that has now come
01:16:57.120 forward that through the bigelow studies
01:16:59.520 it was government funded and then it was
01:17:01.520 personally funded and then government
01:17:03.120 funded
01:17:04.400 it's just one of those things that kind
01:17:06.080 of shakes you because you got this
01:17:08.080 military guy who can't get access
01:17:11.199 because of the private industry that's
01:17:12.960 holding these
01:17:14.320 non-terrestrial materials that they
01:17:16.159 can't study it so that's the the claim
01:17:18.960 right now give it some time let people
01:17:21.199 dig more into this
01:17:22.880 it's fascinating man
01:17:24.719 so
01:17:25.760 you are
01:17:28.000 essentially
01:17:29.360 you're you're
01:17:30.640 you're kicked out right you're you're
01:17:32.560 out of the this program you can't work
01:17:34.640 with these crafts anymore and
01:17:37.199 do they give you any threats do they
01:17:40.320 tell you what you have to do from here
01:17:42.640 on out
01:17:43.679 yeah well i mean the way it ended was
01:17:47.280 um i told george knapp
01:17:49.440 all this stuff and um you know he said
01:17:52.080 well let's just get it on tape should
01:17:53.920 something happen at least we have a
01:17:55.360 record of it and um i don't remember
01:17:58.800 what the emphasis was but um at some
01:18:01.440 point george wanted to air it and he
01:18:03.840 said
01:18:04.719 you know you make the call on it
01:18:07.040 and look if at any point you change your
01:18:09.440 mind
01:18:10.400 we won't air it and it came down to the
01:18:13.280 day where george wants to put her on the
01:18:15.040 five o'clock news he said hey this is
01:18:16.640 important stuff people have to know
01:18:18.080 about it and i thought it was too either
01:18:21.040 it's kind of a crime i know you've got
01:18:22.800 to keep the technology secret but you
01:18:24.880 can't not tell everybody that this stuff
01:18:27.440 is going on that we have you know actual
01:18:30.159 hardware from another civilization it's
01:18:32.159 a big [ __ ] deal you know probably the
01:18:34.960 biggest one there ever was
01:18:36.880 and um
01:18:38.960 george
01:18:40.480 said you know today's the day we got to
01:18:42.159 put it on the news or something to that
01:18:44.000 effect and when it came
01:18:45.840 right down to the time to air it i
01:18:47.600 changed my mind and i said
01:18:50.000 we're not doing it
01:18:51.600 and that's what turned into the famous
01:18:53.920 wrestling match between me and george
01:18:56.080 trying to get the tape but he won
01:18:57.920 because he was a bigger guy so he
01:19:00.000 actually physically wrestled well i
01:19:01.679 think it was more of a pulling match we
01:19:03.360 were i don't think we ever hit the
01:19:04.560 ground but
01:19:06.239 he got the tape he put it in the player
01:19:08.080 and boom five o'clock news was on and
01:19:10.080 then um
01:19:11.199 i got a call after that and they said it
01:19:13.760 was from dennis he said you have any
01:19:15.679 idea what we're gonna do to you now and
01:19:17.840 he hung up the phone that was the last
01:19:19.520 communication i had with him
01:19:22.400 and what has happened to you since then
01:19:24.960 after that
01:19:29.360 a lot of people i've known
01:19:32.400 either were
01:19:34.000 audited by the irs people had anybody i
01:19:37.120 know that had clearances that worked in
01:19:39.280 secure programs had the clearances
01:19:41.520 pulled one of them uh
01:19:44.400 friendly
01:19:45.520 one of mine that jeremy knows he's going
01:19:47.520 on camera with me soon he'll tell the
01:19:49.120 story now that he's out of work up there
01:19:51.280 he was working up at the tonopah test
01:19:53.440 range waiting for his clearance to come
01:19:55.120 through and you know they they pulled
01:19:57.040 that it would it became it's like if
01:19:59.600 they can't get the person that's
01:20:01.120 involved they just create a problem for
01:20:04.320 everybody that surrounds them and so i
01:20:07.120 mean the way it turns out it hurt a lot
01:20:09.120 of people's lives that i was connected
01:20:11.760 to
01:20:12.560 and that's an effective way of shutting
01:20:15.280 someone up did you feel that by coming
01:20:17.679 forward and going public they couldn't
01:20:19.199 just snuff you out that was i mean
01:20:21.040 that's what i was told and george and
01:20:22.800 everybody you know said that you got oh
01:20:24.719 it's you know it's public there's you
01:20:26.400 know no one will touch you and i i you
01:20:28.320 know i i fell for it um
01:20:32.880 and i i wish you didn't yeah sometimes
01:20:36.239 sometimes when it's just over stress and
01:20:37.920 people are camping on your lawn yeah but
01:20:40.080 it's this is gonna make things worse
01:20:42.320 doing this no this is gonna make things
01:20:44.840 better i was trying to tell them how is
01:20:47.199 this gonna make things better because
01:20:48.960 you're getting a real chance to explain
01:20:50.719 yourself in a way that's going to
01:20:53.040 make people who are not only work in the
01:20:56.080 government people that are
01:20:58.400 police officers and firefighters and
01:21:00.719 first responders and doctors and
01:21:02.719 scientists they're going to empathize
01:21:04.880 emphasize
01:21:06.239 empathize and and empathize with
01:21:10.800 what it must be like to be a person like
01:21:12.960 you in your 20s who gets thrust into
01:21:15.920 this world unknowingly
01:21:18.080 and confronted with
01:21:20.560 one of the most if not the most
01:21:22.960 important discovery in the history of
01:21:25.679 human beings the big question
01:21:28.400 are we alone it's the number one
01:21:30.480 question there's two questions right
01:21:32.480 what happens when we die and are we
01:21:34.159 alone those are the two big questions
01:21:36.320 right
01:21:37.120 and if we're not alone and someone knows
01:21:40.800 we're not alone and these some people
01:21:43.600 who know we're not alone are these
01:21:45.840 bungling
01:21:47.360 sort of even if they weren't it's a
01:21:49.760 crime that they're not telling the rest
01:21:52.159 of us but i mean i don't mean bungling
01:21:54.480 in terms they're incompetent i mean they
01:21:56.000 can't be competent it seems to me to
01:21:58.480 what you're describing that no one can
01:22:00.000 be competent with this technology
01:22:02.080 like the victoria victorian era scholars
01:22:05.920 analyzing some sort of a nuclear reactor
01:22:08.320 there's there's no way why do you think
01:22:10.239 beyond that why do you think they're not
01:22:11.440 telling us let's just make an assumption
01:22:12.880 that this is true right now
01:22:14.800 why do you think that they're not
01:22:17.040 telling us that our government doesn't
01:22:18.400 tell us what's your best well let me put
01:22:20.159 it into
01:22:21.120 what would you do if i'm the president
01:22:24.480 okay and i get this information what do
01:22:26.400 i do with this what do i do with this
01:22:27.840 there's something that we don't know
01:22:29.520 there's something we don't understand
01:22:31.120 there's something that came from another
01:22:32.400 world we got it tucked away in the
01:22:34.000 mountains and uh just wanted you guys to
01:22:35.920 know about it hey sleep tight hey
01:22:37.679 american motto's on tonight who do you
01:22:39.280 think's going to win yeah who's going to
01:22:40.880 win america
01:22:44.800 one is uncertainty and the other one is
01:22:46.320 what bob and i have talked about a lot
01:22:47.920 absolutely not knowing what to tell
01:22:50.080 people because you don't really
01:22:51.120 understand it yourself even though
01:22:52.480 you've got what do you say if you want
01:22:54.080 to run a government you want to get
01:22:55.600 people to pay their taxes but there's
01:22:56.880 something else yeah
01:22:58.239 what do you say so you have these
01:22:59.360 objects fine with impunity right and you
01:23:01.520 that you have something else well not
01:23:02.960 only that what can you say like how much
01:23:05.120 do you really know i think it's mainly
01:23:06.800 the technology yeah they just want to
01:23:08.639 keep the technology secret because if
01:23:10.719 there's
01:23:11.600 yeah whoever gets this dude yeah
01:23:14.320 you you control the where you become you
01:23:16.320 literally become invincible once you
01:23:18.560 master the technology you can't you
01:23:20.800 cannot penetrate a field like that so
01:23:23.440 imagine that's i know it's all science
01:23:25.440 fiction but science fiction turns into
01:23:27.120 science fact if you have
01:23:29.360 real force fields around aircraft and
01:23:31.840 battleships
01:23:33.120 you you win
01:23:34.800 you win you can force your will upon
01:23:36.719 anybody and uh
01:23:38.880 like i said there's so much more to the
01:23:40.320 story when i was first there
01:23:42.400 um
01:23:43.679 there were russian scientists at s4 that
01:23:46.480 was this was early on in the project so
01:23:48.400 this was before operation paper clip
01:23:50.239 became public as well right so i would
01:23:51.920 imagine that was i don't know what the
01:23:53.679 date yeah when was that when did was
01:23:55.199 that
01:23:56.159 98 i think 98 yeah yeah i don't know the
01:23:58.880 dates on it so it's roughly 10 years
01:24:00.560 later operation paperclip becomes
01:24:02.800 freedom of information actually it's
01:24:04.159 about russia not germany he's not a
01:24:06.080 russian scientist yeah but i mean
01:24:08.000 russian scientists a lot of them came
01:24:09.679 from germany a lot of those those rocket
01:24:12.159 scientists that work with nasa they all
01:24:14.000 came from nazi scientists got it so some
01:24:16.719 russians got some of them i just know
01:24:18.239 that and at some point there was intense
01:24:20.800 cooperation with even exchanging some
01:24:23.920 ideas on nuclear weapons and you know
01:24:26.000 emp tests and stuff things we would
01:24:28.159 never have discussed with them but at
01:24:29.760 the same time it was in the late 80s uh
01:24:32.639 they were involved and actually in the
01:24:35.040 area at s4 with us so you got to
01:24:38.000 communicate with these guys or you saw
01:24:39.360 them no i knew they were there barry
01:24:41.280 barry would talk about the commies that
01:24:42.880 were there the communities the commies
01:24:45.120 and um that was back when they were the
01:24:47.040 commies
01:24:50.320 and
01:24:52.880 at some point it wasn't our group but at
01:24:55.120 some point there was a big discovery
01:24:57.840 made
01:24:58.880 and this did not happen when i was there
01:25:01.040 it happened in between my trips to there
01:25:03.360 and after that apparently they decided
01:25:05.840 it was just too cool to share with
01:25:07.600 anybody and the russians were never
01:25:09.280 allowed back on the base after that but
01:25:11.360 you don't know what that discovery was
01:25:12.560 no no like i said it wasn't my group so
01:25:14.560 one of the other groups really found out
01:25:17.199 something
01:25:18.400 but the you know
01:25:20.159 in typical american fashion is all right
01:25:22.159 this is ours you guys get the hell out
01:25:23.840 of here was there any inkling that any
01:25:26.639 other government had something similar
01:25:29.600 no no nothing that i had heard see that
01:25:31.840 was the thing that always freaked me out
01:25:33.360 was why if if something was so superior
01:25:36.880 to human beings it's almost like
01:25:38.159 visiting an ant colony like why would
01:25:40.560 you go to the queen i don't give a [ __ ]
01:25:41.920 who the queen is i'm a human i'm so
01:25:44.000 superior to ants i don't care who you
01:25:45.840 have running your hive i'm just gonna
01:25:47.520 study it i think it's who got it who got
01:25:50.239 it look at the
01:25:51.600 you know rocket technology in germany
01:25:53.600 but they got nine of them
01:25:55.840 yeah that doesn't make sense to me
01:25:57.920 either so they were either in the same
01:26:00.239 area
01:26:01.280 or you know one had clues to where
01:26:03.440 others were
01:26:04.880 i mean i don't know you you have to fill
01:26:06.639 that in there but you're right i mean
01:26:08.080 nine of them that's a that's a a big dig
01:26:11.280 if it was archaeological well one of the
01:26:13.199 more recent
01:26:14.960 recent sightings and the these
01:26:17.280 discussions that have been coming out
01:26:18.800 recently from air force pilots and navy
01:26:21.040 pilots they've been talking about things
01:26:22.400 happening in the ocean
01:26:24.080 and that that something
01:26:25.760 go literally goes into the water or
01:26:28.159 something maybe below the surface
01:26:29.440 thinking about water 2004 tic tac nimitz
01:26:31.760 case so that's when george knapp and i
01:26:33.520 broke on the radio twice before the new
01:26:35.040 york times so i know this one really
01:26:36.400 well commander fravor and those pilots
01:26:38.960 there was
01:26:40.159 a disturbance on the surface of the
01:26:42.480 water
01:26:43.520 commander fravor visually saw what
01:26:45.840 looked like similar to across some
01:26:48.239 object so it's like as if you have some
01:26:50.239 like coral under the water and you've
01:26:51.520 got it's breaking over right the tic tac
01:26:54.000 is doing this crazy maneuver that defies
01:26:56.800 it's a gravity-propelled system they saw
01:26:58.480 it in the sky before they saw in the
01:26:59.920 water right yeah so there was um there
01:27:02.000 were radar that was picking this these
01:27:03.600 things coming down from 80 000 feet
01:27:05.360 dropping to 50 feet in less than a
01:27:07.280 second this is it jamie what is this
01:27:09.360 this is actually on the news today there
01:27:10.880 was a briefing so a lot of people get
01:27:12.560 this confused not this one then either
01:27:14.639 no so
01:27:15.600 that is called the gimbal so there's
01:27:17.600 three videos released by the pentagon
01:27:19.920 that are all active play and keep the
01:27:21.440 volume off
01:27:23.280 i i would i would really just pay
01:27:24.719 attention to the source video so you've
01:27:26.400 got the tic tac which is this object the
01:27:28.480 commander fravor saw another pilot
01:27:30.800 filmed it with a flir pod and it goes
01:27:33.679 but this one you see is really important
01:27:35.360 to bob's story the gimbal craft it's
01:27:38.480 been recently analyzed it's fleer not
01:27:41.360 only does it it's definitive that it's
01:27:44.080 not a conventional anything by the by
01:27:46.800 its movements but there's a pocket of
01:27:48.639 cold air
01:27:49.920 around a propulsion source
01:27:52.159 so this object by the way sat stationary
01:27:55.120 for days if not weeks it sat stationary
01:27:58.080 yeah they found it 11 hours later and
01:28:00.239 they were saying there's no way this
01:28:01.760 thing using that kind of energy to go
01:28:03.840 that fast could just hover the amount of
01:28:05.920 time and by the way you're seeing a very
01:28:08.000 small part of what happened that day
01:28:10.080 this object was not alone
01:28:12.320 and so hopefully that information comes
01:28:14.719 out and we can i mean i wish we had
01:28:16.960 video of it i'm sure we'd all want to
01:28:18.480 see it
01:28:19.600 but that's called the gimbal that was
01:28:21.199 east coast
01:28:22.560 right 2015.
01:28:24.960 west coast 2004 was the tic tac
01:28:27.600 the disturbance on the water commander
01:28:29.600 fraber believes there was something
01:28:31.120 under that water that was causing that
01:28:33.040 disturbance when the tic tac was coming
01:28:34.480 around to doing it
01:28:35.840 with inside the the people that are
01:28:37.679 studying this they're thinking maybe the
01:28:39.679 tic tac system was causing the
01:28:41.520 disturbance
01:28:42.400 but the uso unidentified submerged
01:28:45.440 object that he visually saw
01:28:48.480 uh the whole interesting thing about
01:28:49.920 that is i would love bob to describe it
01:28:52.320 is why it doesn't matter if these craft
01:28:54.560 are in
01:28:55.520 space
01:28:56.560 air or water why doesn't it matter i
01:28:58.800 love when he talks about this [ __ ]
01:29:00.960 well first of all commander fravor was
01:29:02.800 the f-18 pilot off the nimitz that was
01:29:05.760 sent out to find out what this stuff is
01:29:07.600 but and it wasn't just i got a chance to
01:29:10.800 talk to him recently and it wasn't just
01:29:13.440 a radar image i mean commander fravor
01:29:15.760 had eyes on it for over five minutes
01:29:18.800 watching this thing as four other pilots
01:29:21.360 did so this wasn't a radar blip or
01:29:23.280 anything i mean these guys were watching
01:29:24.880 this thing but
01:29:27.679 you know one of the things i think in
01:29:29.199 the gimbal video
01:29:31.840 the way the craft that we worked on
01:29:34.800 flies
01:29:36.239 is it doesn't fly like
01:29:39.280 a conventional aircraft does and it
01:29:41.520 doesn't fly like a flying saucer with in
01:29:43.920 a 1950s movie it flies belly first
01:29:47.760 i mean it may set down conventionally
01:29:50.639 but it always rotates it does a role
01:29:53.040 maneuver puts its belly towards the
01:29:55.040 target and then moves away so it's like
01:29:57.280 a car flying with the wheels forward
01:30:00.000 right
01:30:00.800 right
01:30:01.679 i mean it may lift land on the wheels
01:30:03.600 but at some point when it wants to leave
01:30:05.600 flips flips up points the wheels where
01:30:07.679 it wants to go and takes off and the
01:30:09.360 gimbal video you can see the craft do
01:30:12.000 the roll maneuver and uh
01:30:14.480 it's really interesting it behaves
01:30:15.840 exactly like the crafts that i worked on
01:30:18.560 so
01:30:19.520 much like we have different shaped
01:30:21.120 aircrafts and fighter jets and cars they
01:30:24.239 probably have different shapes of these
01:30:27.199 objects that operate under similar
01:30:29.520 principles
01:30:30.719 right but they all have the same power
01:30:33.040 source they all have the same power
01:30:34.159 source and we're also dealing with
01:30:36.480 if you think about
01:30:38.800 the laws of technological progression
01:30:41.760 you know you think of moore's law and
01:30:43.520 you think of how things accelerate
01:30:46.320 you've got to think that if this
01:30:47.920 civilization is who knows how many years
01:30:50.560 more advanced than we are
01:30:52.239 if not even years i mean i mean we're
01:30:54.800 thinking about in terms of conventional
01:30:56.239 terms right the way the way we look at
01:30:57.760 the world i mean they meet they might be
01:31:00.400 just
01:31:01.199 superior in terms of their intellect
01:31:03.760 they've got to be maybe maybe we don't
01:31:05.920 know right well the only reason i
01:31:07.760 i say that is because
01:31:11.360 look everyone doesn't necessarily start
01:31:13.679 at a steam engine right and go to an
01:31:15.760 internal combustion engine and then you
01:31:18.080 know electric power nuclear power and go
01:31:20.000 up the ladder that we right come on um
01:31:22.960 you know the binary if the stuff is true
01:31:24.960 about the origin and the binary star
01:31:26.800 system and they have heavier elements
01:31:28.560 that we don't have and this element
01:31:30.800 stable element 115 is a naturally
01:31:32.960 occurring material
01:31:34.560 maybe that's the first thing they
01:31:36.159 started experimenting with and the
01:31:38.080 version of their steam engine their
01:31:39.760 first product was something that
01:31:42.400 operated like this and actually when
01:31:44.080 they came to earth to look around or you
01:31:46.480 know whatever they were amazed at the
01:31:48.320 stuff we were doing these guys burned
01:31:50.080 stuff and squirted out the back to go
01:31:51.840 forward so right um right you know who
01:31:54.560 says they follow any kind of normal
01:31:56.080 progression like that my my thought was
01:31:58.880 if you went back to the 1400s and then
01:32:01.840 you went from 1400 to 1500 you're not
01:32:04.239 going to see that much of a difference
01:32:05.600 technologically right if you go from
01:32:08.560 2000 to 3000 i assume there's going to
01:32:11.120 be a radical change right well the yeah
01:32:13.679 the delta the rate of change is is
01:32:16.880 magnificently higher than it used to be
01:32:19.840 right so if you think about what they
01:32:22.960 had in 1988 and you think about what
01:32:25.520 they probably have in 2019
01:32:28.960 just
01:32:30.239 logically seems like they would advance
01:32:32.639 i would think so
01:32:34.400 the only
01:32:35.360 question is like
01:32:36.639 are they living
01:32:38.639 is that a living thing in terms of like
01:32:40.719 a biological thing
01:32:42.480 or are they some sort of an artificially
01:32:45.520 created creation like we are working on
01:32:47.840 right now i mean we're in the middle of
01:32:49.199 working on artificial reality artificial
01:32:52.159 beings sentient beings artificial
01:32:54.080 intelligence there's cons silicon based
01:32:56.239 life forms that they're essentially
01:32:57.440 trying to create boston dynamic or was
01:33:00.000 it boston dynamics of the company
01:33:02.239 robots yeah you can make machines out of
01:33:04.080 flesh right so a cyborg or cybernetic
01:33:06.800 organism is just that you know that's
01:33:08.239 what a lot of people think those like
01:33:09.679 gray things are you know that people
01:33:11.440 call the grays yeah it's like they were
01:33:13.360 like they're machines printed from flash
01:33:16.239 so what you're saying is like well they
01:33:18.080 could just be no synthetic
01:33:20.400 they don't even need to be you know
01:33:22.560 machines well they seem to have no sex
01:33:24.719 organs the way they're described by
01:33:25.920 people that have had interactions with
01:33:27.440 them assuming these people aren't liars
01:33:28.880 right or crazy or whatever right that
01:33:31.600 they have no sex organs and that they
01:33:34.480 don't seem to have any muscle that is
01:33:36.639 almost like a frame right and they have
01:33:38.880 enormous heads i mean if you look at
01:33:42.880 australopithecus or depictions of you
01:33:45.520 know ancient hominids and then you go to
01:33:47.120 human beings one of the things you see
01:33:48.960 is bigger heads and weaker bodies well
01:33:50.880 you see a clear progression of evolution
01:33:53.040 too where for something like that i
01:33:55.679 would lean towards a synthetic organism
01:33:58.320 because it looks like it was made for a
01:34:00.080 specific task there was no reproductive
01:34:02.400 organs so i mean that almost kind of
01:34:04.560 leaves out any kind of you know physical
01:34:06.880 evolution right well that's also our
01:34:08.880 bottleneck right our bottleneck is our
01:34:10.639 biological imperative the the need to
01:34:13.280 breed emotions fear anxiety all these
01:34:16.800 different things that exist in order to
01:34:19.520 force us into making sure we reproduce i
01:34:22.800 mean that's essentially there's human
01:34:24.320 reward systems that aren't necessary
01:34:26.880 once they can figure out a way to make
01:34:28.719 some sort of sentient artificial life
01:34:31.679 some sort of thing that doesn't have
01:34:33.120 these biological limitations that we
01:34:34.800 have by the way these craft all these
01:34:36.960 different kinds have been reported
01:34:38.159 because it was confusing i always
01:34:39.120 thought of flying saucers what i heard
01:34:40.560 bob lazar talk about flying saucer right
01:34:43.040 but if you look back in history people
01:34:44.719 have always reported the weirdest shapes
01:34:46.960 like none of them are alike you know
01:34:49.120 there are the saucers but you got cigar
01:34:51.040 shaped you got you know the top hat
01:34:53.120 shape you have orbs why maybe they're
01:34:56.000 serving different purposes they're doing
01:34:57.760 different things like we'd use different
01:34:59.280 tools and i want to be clear the reason
01:35:01.840 i know that memo is real is because i
01:35:03.840 spent a lot of time with dr edgar
01:35:05.520 mitchell six man to walk on the moon
01:35:07.360 last guy to film him before he died
01:35:09.360 right
01:35:10.320 that's how i know i don't want any
01:35:11.840 journalists thinking i got it from
01:35:13.120 anywhere else i know because of dr
01:35:14.880 mitchell and he said the same thing
01:35:16.480 maybe these things are
01:35:18.480 performing different tasks you know and
01:35:21.199 that's what i seem if you if you think
01:35:22.960 about what an alien is in terms of our
01:35:25.360 our
01:35:26.159 the sort of iconic image of an alien
01:35:28.320 like the steven spielberg closing cows
01:35:30.320 are the third time the third kind alien
01:35:33.679 they seem like
01:35:35.840 what we'd assume a human being would
01:35:37.840 eventually become right
01:35:39.760 and if these things are tiny human
01:35:41.520 beings are smaller than they've ever
01:35:42.719 been before they're weaker than they've
01:35:43.920 ever been before and there seems to be a
01:35:45.360 trend in that direction and this trend
01:35:48.080 seems to be amplified by our
01:35:50.560 technological progression
01:35:52.480 there our
01:35:53.520 lack of need for muscle strength and our
01:35:55.840 lack of need for violence and we're
01:35:57.920 moving in a society to try to get away
01:36:00.320 from all the things that we think are
01:36:01.760 abhorrent about human beings and the
01:36:03.840 terrible behaviors that we have if we
01:36:06.719 one day do give birth to some sort of an
01:36:10.239 artificial being like marshall mcluhan's
01:36:13.440 uh
01:36:14.400 quote we are the sex organs of the
01:36:16.639 machine world
01:36:18.080 you know that one day okay i'll buy this
01:36:20.560 yeah mcloone was brilliant and that that
01:36:23.040 quote has always been one of my
01:36:24.239 favorites because okay what are we doing
01:36:26.480 when we're constantly technologically
01:36:28.400 innovating we're constantly looking for
01:36:30.639 faster cars better computers bigger
01:36:32.719 screens faster more resolution more
01:36:35.040 pixels more this more that higher
01:36:36.560 bandwidth 5g 10g right what are we doing
01:36:39.280 we're moving into this in this if you
01:36:41.440 just follow it objectively stay stand
01:36:43.679 back don't attach yourself or your
01:36:45.360 civilization your culture to it and look
01:36:47.040 at what it is we're moving
01:36:49.679 a hundred percent towards technological
01:36:52.320 innovation if you looked at this species
01:36:54.400 from afar and if you weren't a part of
01:36:56.320 it you would say what does this species
01:36:57.679 do oh they make things they make things
01:37:00.000 better every year beehives are the same
01:37:02.080 [ __ ] thing that you see 10 years ago
01:37:04.000 you go by you see a beehive it's amazing
01:37:05.920 it's cool but they're the same [ __ ]
01:37:07.280 thing they figured out how to do it they
01:37:08.800 make a beehive right we don't do that we
01:37:11.119 make better things what would you
01:37:12.560 constantly and at some point i think
01:37:14.719 that technology is going to fuse with us
01:37:16.719 yes and we're going to become it's
01:37:17.920 already happening yeah elon musk talked
01:37:19.679 about it on my podcast that we are
01:37:21.119 cyborgs you just carry it in your pocket
01:37:22.719 it's a phone it answers any question you
01:37:24.719 want you can talk to it it'll give you
01:37:26.480 the answers the answers instantaneously
01:37:28.880 it navigates you it has all your phone
01:37:31.119 numbers and it has all your contacts you
01:37:32.719 can get a hold of people people
01:37:33.840 listening to you through it it's
01:37:35.360 connecting us in ways even involuntarily
01:37:37.760 haptics that kind of thing yeah it's
01:37:39.280 also getting on your wrist how many
01:37:40.800 people have eye watches apple watches
01:37:43.520 right and that's only because we can't
01:37:45.360 integrate them yet but you know that
01:37:47.040 point is 100
01:37:48.400 yeah i didn't joke about it last night
01:37:50.080 but i have a bit about it that i do
01:37:51.920 about the the integration between humans
01:37:53.679 and technology that's what would you do
01:37:55.679 if you were a hyper intelligence right
01:37:58.159 would you do the work yourself or would
01:37:59.920 you create some cool things called like
01:38:01.760 humans to do it for you would you create
01:38:03.920 things that are cybernetic organisms to
01:38:05.520 come in with machines and do it for you
01:38:07.840 if you're a hyper intelligence that has
01:38:09.840 kind of changed like you've described
01:38:11.760 you'd probably create workers right well
01:38:13.840 that's a vast conspiracy theory i'm not
01:38:16.159 talking about conspiracy but it is a
01:38:17.600 kind of a conspiracy i'm asking you well
01:38:19.600 i mean i don't think it's necessarily
01:38:21.600 that i mean you could look at it that
01:38:23.600 way but that is the way a conspiracy
01:38:25.360 theorist would look at it the way i
01:38:26.480 would look at it is like there's
01:38:27.520 obviously a progression going on a
01:38:29.360 biological progression there's some sort
01:38:31.679 of an integration with technology
01:38:33.440 there's some sort of imperative this
01:38:35.360 need for technological innovation it's
01:38:37.600 inescapable everyone has it we and i
01:38:39.840 think it's attached to materialism in
01:38:41.440 some sort of a strange way because so
01:38:43.600 many people work so hard to get new
01:38:45.760 things and like god that seems so
01:38:47.520 illogical and preposterous and it makes
01:38:49.040 people unhappy and depression's on the
01:38:50.400 rise but nobody seems to be able to stop
01:38:52.000 it like why is that well maybe it's
01:38:54.719 because we are the
01:38:57.760 caterpillars that give birth to the
01:38:59.679 butterfly maybe that's what we're doing
01:39:02.080 very well what our job is to do is to
01:39:04.480 make some sort of a cocoon and we don't
01:39:06.480 even know we're doing it while we're
01:39:08.400 doing it do you think a caterpillar is
01:39:10.159 well hey caterpillar what are you doing
01:39:11.840 man just i'm doing my thing it's my job
01:39:14.159 i have to make a cocoon then become like
01:39:15.600 a body this could be a natural part of
01:39:17.280 evolution it could be that we're just
01:39:18.960 supposed to do this exactly and make the
01:39:20.960 jump to
01:39:21.920 some sort of mechanized right
01:39:24.239 yeah non-biological an orangutan that is
01:39:27.440 uh fishing with a spear
01:39:30.239 no they they've figured out how to fish
01:39:32.800 with spears there's
01:39:34.320 uh there's um
01:39:36.080 primatologists
01:39:37.440 without somebody showing them how to
01:39:39.040 fish no they've imitated human beings
01:39:41.119 doing it and now they do it but they do
01:39:43.440 it independently they're not trained
01:39:45.679 orangutans they're wild around look at
01:39:47.440 that
01:39:48.960 there's a wild rice okay that's
01:39:50.400 impressive very impressive well there's
01:39:53.360 these primatologists i guess you would
01:39:54.960 call them primatologists that's a term
01:39:56.639 that's a great biologist biologists that
01:39:58.639 believe that
01:40:00.320 monkeys and chimps
01:40:02.239 and some of the great apes are moving
01:40:04.639 into the stone age that they've
01:40:06.080 currently entered the stone age like
01:40:08.159 they're not staying what they were a
01:40:10.880 hundred thousand years ago or five
01:40:12.560 hundred thousand years ago but they're
01:40:14.000 actively using tools and they're
01:40:16.000 experimenting with different different
01:40:17.760 ways to use those tools and then they're
01:40:19.840 making tools out of stone they're making
01:40:21.760 tools out of sticks and they're they're
01:40:23.280 using them
01:40:24.560 well this might just be what happens
01:40:27.920 this might just be what happens
01:40:30.480 i mean why else why would why the [ __ ]
01:40:32.560 we work so hard i mean i i was i was
01:40:34.800 driving to la this morning um i had a
01:40:36.880 doctor's appointment so i was on the 405
01:40:38.960 at uh eight in the morning like jesus
01:40:40.960 christ like this is so crazy when you're
01:40:43.119 in the 405 in l.a at eight o'clock in
01:40:44.639 the morning you see literally a million
01:40:46.320 cars
01:40:47.199 and this is everywhere you go as people
01:40:49.119 but and also i'm in a tesla so i have it
01:40:52.000 on autopilot so i'm there sitting i'm
01:40:54.239 listening to a podcast i barely have my
01:40:56.400 hand on the wheel i'm not touching [ __ ]
01:40:58.239 this car's driving me along i'm not even
01:41:00.719 doing anything i'm just i'm just hanging
01:41:02.880 out it's so much less stressful by the
01:41:04.560 way to do that that way right so it
01:41:06.239 encourages you to innovate it encourages
01:41:08.639 you to embrace this new technology i got
01:41:11.199 this giant screen it's showing me the
01:41:12.880 navigation in front of me i'll be there
01:41:15.119 five minutes early excellent and i'm
01:41:17.119 listening to a podcast wirelessly it's
01:41:19.760 bluetooth screen streaming from my phone
01:41:22.000 and i pulled that podcast which came out
01:41:24.159 today out of the [ __ ] sky and i'm
01:41:26.480 listening to it and i'm all comfortable
01:41:28.239 in my nice little car just driving on my
01:41:30.159 way to the doctor's office this is
01:41:31.600 irresistible stuff yeah yeah different
01:41:33.440 than your walkman yeah you know that can
01:41:35.360 be irresistible
01:41:37.040 it is a resistance it's frighteningly
01:41:38.800 irresistible but is it frightening i
01:41:40.400 mean if you were a monkey right if you
01:41:42.080 were um an australiopithecus would you
01:41:44.560 go man i don't want to [ __ ] be a
01:41:46.080 person i live in a house that's [ __ ]
01:41:48.320 i like just swinging around on trees i
01:41:50.560 like uh running from jaguars this is
01:41:52.400 life guys life is running from
01:41:54.480 crocodiles it's not living in a [ __ ]
01:41:56.000 suburban there's probably some that are
01:41:57.679 like that yeah i don't think so i think
01:41:59.920 i think
01:42:00.880 when it comes we're going to embrace it
01:42:02.560 we're going to embrace it the same way
01:42:03.920 you embrace cell phones the same way
01:42:05.840 embrace television there's going to be a
01:42:07.440 few holdouts i don't even have an email
01:42:08.960 address man those are those there's a
01:42:10.880 few and far between the good luck with
01:42:12.480 that [ __ ] face go move to the woods ted
01:42:14.239 kaczynski yeah i was just going to throw
01:42:16.159 ted's against
01:42:17.280 ted kaczynski was right this is
01:42:18.880 something that i think about sometimes
01:42:20.239 when i get really high that ted
01:42:22.159 kaczynski was a part of the harvard lsd
01:42:25.199 studies this has been proven ted
01:42:26.880 kaczynski they cooked his [ __ ] brain
01:42:29.119 when he was at harvard and then when he
01:42:30.800 went over to berkeley and became a
01:42:32.000 professor his goal was to make enough
01:42:33.920 money so that he could
01:42:35.360 implement this program and live in the
01:42:37.119 woods and then write his manifesto and
01:42:39.119 start killing people that were involved
01:42:41.199 in propagating technology he was
01:42:43.119 expunged from the harvard uh logs by the
01:42:46.480 way this is something my friend just
01:42:47.760 called me about so there's like this uh
01:42:50.239 private library and they used to print
01:42:52.719 people's names whenever they were part
01:42:54.159 of a university and he was one of a
01:42:55.920 handful of people that were expunged
01:42:58.159 from it i want to jump back to the one
01:43:00.080 thing joe
01:43:01.440 i want to be very careful with that word
01:43:02.960 conspiracy theorist
01:43:04.639 what i was what i was saying to you was
01:43:06.639 we we terraform our earth right
01:43:08.960 we terraform we change the environment
01:43:10.719 we do all this innovation
01:43:12.480 what is stopping us from thinking that
01:43:14.639 that's not being done i'm not saying it
01:43:16.400 is i'm saying what's stopping us from
01:43:18.080 thinking that that's being done on a
01:43:20.000 much bigger level on a cosmic level you
01:43:22.560 mean like aliens coming down doing that
01:43:24.239 to humans i'm telling you that there is
01:43:26.320 something here that's there's a fact you
01:43:28.400 know there's something there a craft
01:43:30.400 they're here they're not ours they're
01:43:31.920 here so the question is
01:43:34.239 what is that about and i'm just looking
01:43:35.920 at what we do with what you're
01:43:37.280 describing with technology
01:43:39.199 i think it's much more likely that the
01:43:41.360 same way we observe chimps and we
01:43:43.760 observed that they are now in the stone
01:43:45.679 age that they're observing us and that
01:43:47.679 they're recognizing that there is a
01:43:49.040 pattern that there is uh there's steps
01:43:51.280 that happen i mean carl sagan talked
01:43:53.440 about the different levels of
01:43:54.960 civilization and that you know if we
01:43:56.639 don't get past certain levels we're
01:43:58.560 never going to reach this i mean we're
01:44:00.639 in type 1 civilization we're going to
01:44:01.920 stay at type zero well we're in this
01:44:03.520 warring
01:44:04.719 polluting yeah pillaging we're awesome
01:44:07.679 civilizations
01:44:08.960 are awesome it's like well we're awesome
01:44:10.480 in a lot of ways you know but in that
01:44:12.000 way we're not well yeah we're we're
01:44:14.000 children that have immense power that we
01:44:16.080 didn't really the other thing is you're
01:44:17.920 using the immense power that other
01:44:20.159 people have created right i mean even
01:44:22.080 when you're driving a car you're
01:44:23.199 stomping on the gas like whew you didn't
01:44:25.360 invent the [ __ ] engine you didn't
01:44:27.280 invent tires there's all these things
01:44:29.199 that were in involved in the creation of
01:44:31.360 this thing that is
01:44:33.600 really outside of your
01:44:34.790 [Music]
01:44:35.920 grasp of understanding but yet you have
01:44:38.159 the ability to use it like a person with
01:44:39.760 a gun i'm just gonna bang bang bang
01:44:41.760 people you don't you didn't invent a gun
01:44:43.679 so like you've you've without the
01:44:45.600 intellect to craft and engineer and and
01:44:49.760 and manifest these creations you just
01:44:52.159 have access to them because you have
01:44:53.520 paper or you have bitcoin or you have
01:44:55.360 whatever the [ __ ] you're using using a
01:44:56.719 credit card now you have
01:44:58.880 almost no responsibility you just you
01:45:01.280 could just flippantly use these things
01:45:03.360 which is why
01:45:04.560 we uh
01:45:05.679 you know we're very childlike in our
01:45:07.440 actions because we haven't had to earn
01:45:10.320 the responsibility we haven't had to
01:45:12.000 earn these things that we've been able
01:45:14.400 to have and you've only been able to
01:45:16.239 have them because other people have
01:45:18.239 innovated and spent
01:45:20.000 ungodly amounts of time and effort and
01:45:22.239 focus in the lab to create these things
01:45:24.320 and then they've all put them together
01:45:26.159 and then what is the what's the reason
01:45:27.920 to put them together to profit well
01:45:29.440 what's the reason of prop well why are
01:45:31.040 you doing this so you can buy more
01:45:32.080 things what are we doing what are we
01:45:34.159 doing we're making better things that's
01:45:36.400 what we do that's all that's all we do
01:45:38.159 is make better things yeah why the [ __ ]
01:45:39.679 do we need oil why do we need oil why
01:45:41.360 can't we just burn wood and stay home
01:45:43.679 why can't we grow chickens and food in
01:45:45.840 the backyard why can't we do well we
01:45:47.600 [ __ ] can we certainly can people do
01:45:49.679 do it but we decide to make that almost
01:45:52.239 impossible our preferred way of living
01:45:54.159 is to stuff everyone into a very small
01:45:56.560 area where no one grows anything other
01:45:57.920 than weed
01:45:59.119 this is what la is la is 20 million
01:46:02.080 people with hard surfaces as many hard
01:46:04.560 surfaces as you can boy if you've got an
01:46:06.400 acre backyard in l.a holy [ __ ] look at
01:46:08.480 all that green this is amazing well no
01:46:10.639 that's the [ __ ] earth coming through
01:46:13.280 this weird sort of creation that we've
01:46:15.920 put on top of the earth but the goal is
01:46:17.760 that like new york city that's there's
01:46:19.520 none of it right you just got you've got
01:46:21.360 central park and they just got human
01:46:23.199 [ __ ] you stacked up no one's growing
01:46:25.600 anything and then constant work
01:46:27.840 everyone's up early go go go
01:46:30.800 innovate progress make that money so you
01:46:33.199 can buy more things and every year hey
01:46:35.840 apple where's this [ __ ] new phone as
01:46:38.000 if your phone isn't good enough yeah
01:46:40.320 like your phone's taking pictures and
01:46:42.159 videos and people are calling you and
01:46:44.560 you got applications to tell you which
01:46:46.159 way the wind's blowing it's not good
01:46:48.000 enough a blink of an eye blink of an eye
01:46:49.920 it's all gone though that you know like
01:46:51.440 10 000 years and the hoover dam goes or
01:46:53.600 whatever you know mount rushmore
01:46:55.199 disintegrates so it's amazing because we
01:46:57.199 have created that and and everything's
01:46:58.960 trying to spring up through that we keep
01:47:00.400 it maintenance down but we're we're a
01:47:02.480 blink man something hits
01:47:04.400 but we don't think that way well you
01:47:05.840 know you think in terms of your own life
01:47:07.600 right you think in terms of what you
01:47:09.199 want and what you need right now
01:47:11.360 you know what it's we are in many ways
01:47:14.000 this combination of this weird primitive
01:47:16.800 ape-like thing
01:47:18.639 with
01:47:19.679 the ability to calculate and manipulate
01:47:22.719 our world and our environment that makes
01:47:24.480 us wholly unique on top of that with
01:47:26.080 existential angst and and fear so what
01:47:28.960 do you do with that we [ __ ] water it
01:47:30.239 down with the anti-depressants give
01:47:32.320 these [ __ ] people some [ __ ] that
01:47:33.520 keeps them moving
01:47:34.719 they're worried about the future they're
01:47:36.000 trying to figure out what reality is if
01:47:37.520 this you're on a goddamn convertible
01:47:39.440 spaceship spinning a thousand miles an
01:47:41.199 hour hurling through infinity there's no
01:47:43.760 meaning to this thing just keep making
01:47:45.440 [ __ ] keep making stuff and then one day
01:47:48.719 they're going to be able to hit that
01:47:49.920 switch and this life will be born out of
01:47:53.040 innovation and thinking and progress and
01:47:56.159 technology and more than likely it's
01:47:59.280 probably going to be what we're seeing
01:48:01.040 that these things are that you're you're
01:48:03.280 observing
01:48:04.560 i'm not observing them but yeah
01:48:06.080 someone's obviously
01:48:07.199 are you implying that they're us
01:48:09.119 i don't think they are us but i think
01:48:11.040 they are what happens when things keep
01:48:13.520 going
01:48:15.040 it's not us just like we're not monkeys
01:48:16.960 right i'm not a chimp
01:48:19.040 oh that'd be cool
01:48:20.239 they're from here is your idea no no no
01:48:23.280 that this is what happens all over the
01:48:25.040 universe right yeah this is what
01:48:26.960 happened look here's the thing you know
01:48:28.560 i went to see brian cox's um
01:48:31.360 he has this amazing live show with robin
01:48:34.639 ins where they
01:48:35.920 they have these led screens these huge
01:48:39.199 screens with high resolution depictions
01:48:42.000 of the cosmos and one of the most
01:48:43.600 mind-blowing things
01:48:45.679 was he has this large-scale image of the
01:48:48.719 universe and it shows all the individual
01:48:51.520 galaxies of the universe and it just
01:48:52.880 keeps moving through all these galaxies
01:48:55.040 in three dimensions
01:48:56.400 and it's [ __ ] incredible but what's
01:48:58.560 stunning is the relative uniformity of
01:49:01.199 it even at you know i mean you're
01:49:03.440 obviously looking at
01:49:05.520 an incredibly small depiction of
01:49:07.920 something that's immensely large like a
01:49:10.000 galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars
01:49:11.760 you're seeing it as this little dot but
01:49:13.600 this little dot that's flying through
01:49:16.159 space surrounded by other little darts
01:49:18.719 with very similarly spaced distances
01:49:22.080 yeah
01:49:23.360 yeah so mike if we see uniformity in
01:49:25.840 that form in terms of like the distance
01:49:28.320 between galaxy so many galaxies is so
01:49:30.639 it's so similar they might vary slightly
01:49:32.960 and that slightly might be hundreds of
01:49:34.400 millions of light years right but but
01:49:36.400 but there's so much uniformity why would
01:49:38.880 we not assume that that uniformity
01:49:41.040 exists pretty much everywhere and that
01:49:43.119 all these things that you're seeing that
01:49:44.560 are so similar you do see binary star
01:49:47.199 systems you do see single star systems
01:49:49.199 like star but there's also some some
01:49:50.880 speculation that earth and that our
01:49:52.480 solar system is one time was a binary
01:49:54.480 star system right i mean that's one of
01:49:56.239 the the speculations about that that
01:49:58.400 object that they find outside the kuiper
01:50:00.400 belt that they think is 10 times larger
01:50:01.920 than earth they think it might have been
01:50:03.199 at one point in time a star but this
01:50:06.000 this uniformity that you see why
01:50:07.840 wouldn't we think that that
01:50:09.360 that has its same implications
01:50:11.760 biologically that there's some sort of a
01:50:13.840 biological uniformity and that this
01:50:15.840 happens
01:50:16.880 given the right sets of circumstances
01:50:19.440 you should tell them some of the stuff
01:50:20.800 that you read that you don't know is
01:50:22.880 true i mean if the the stuff was true
01:50:24.960 about the
01:50:26.159 propulsion stuff i mean anyway he well
01:50:28.159 what have you read
01:50:29.440 what you saw too and you know what are
01:50:31.679 you talking about
01:50:34.000 spill the beans bob
01:50:36.159 i gotta poke the bear here let's get
01:50:37.600 some more liquor in you
01:50:39.840 the um
01:50:42.080 well i mean
01:50:43.679 the again the the only thing i could
01:50:46.320 verify was what i had my hands on um
01:50:49.840 they were
01:50:51.040 you know there was talk of weapon
01:50:52.719 systems that there were different
01:50:54.320 projects project galileo project
01:50:56.800 sidekick was supposed to be weapon
01:50:58.320 applications of the craft
01:51:00.960 project looking glass had to do with
01:51:03.199 time any effects of time in the craft
01:51:05.600 now i don't think we're not
01:51:07.600 talking about making a time machine like
01:51:09.679 in science fiction but we're talking
01:51:11.600 about you know small distortions
01:51:13.440 intentional distortions of time and how
01:51:15.840 that can be
01:51:16.960 used
01:51:18.000 you know as a uh not as a well it was
01:51:21.199 part of a weapon program how are you
01:51:22.800 informed in this these again where
01:51:24.480 there's just those small briefings that
01:51:26.239 i read but
01:51:27.920 again i don't really like to talk about
01:51:29.600 those because i don't have any
01:51:30.880 information on them and it was just you
01:51:32.719 know small briefings but he told
01:51:34.480 commander fravor that what he saw might
01:51:36.639 have been a time dilation
01:51:39.360 well it could be because gravity affects
01:51:41.520 time you know space time i'm sure you've
01:51:43.679 heard of that and um
01:51:46.400 you know what what commander fraber saw
01:51:49.199 as he was in the f-18 approaching it he
01:51:52.239 said that he described it as a
01:51:54.960 ping-pong ball in a cup and shaking it
01:51:56.639 back and forth it was moving that fast
01:51:59.040 now obviously if there's anything inside
01:52:00.800 there
01:52:01.599 it it's going to be battered to hell but
01:52:04.400 you know my point was was that well one
01:52:07.040 of two things
01:52:08.560 either there's a gravitational envelope
01:52:10.719 in there which negates any inertia
01:52:13.199 effects
01:52:14.159 or
01:52:15.599 you are seeing through a gravity
01:52:17.520 distortion field
01:52:19.520 so you know just like you're looking at
01:52:21.360 a
01:52:22.080 a hot highway and you see
01:52:24.800 you know an optical distortion going
01:52:26.960 through there well the same thing
01:52:28.239 happens in gravity and the craft may not
01:52:30.239 actually be moving like that it may just
01:52:32.239 look like it because you're seeing you
01:52:34.800 can only see it through the field so it
01:52:37.679 may be making much more gentle moves i'm
01:52:40.239 not saying that's it but it has to be
01:52:42.719 one of the two
01:52:44.400 and the thing shows up 60 miles away
01:52:46.800 they noticed it on radar 60 seconds
01:52:49.920 after left commander favor but it was at
01:52:52.400 his cap point which is the next point he
01:52:54.239 was destined to go to
01:52:56.080 60 miles away and in 60 seconds on radar
01:53:00.320 the same object ends up there so it's
01:53:03.679 going a mile a second no
01:53:05.920 they i think the radar just picked it up
01:53:08.000 in 60 seconds
01:53:09.599 yeah it could have been there instantly
01:53:11.119 but yeah we don't know the cycle time
01:53:13.440 nobody knows that that's whole thing oh
01:53:15.360 so it cycles like radar cycles yeah it
01:53:18.239 doesn't it doesn't sweep but i mean it
01:53:20.480 scans yeah it's a planar array so it
01:53:22.800 just
01:53:23.520 you know
01:53:24.320 scans around it at random places that's
01:53:26.080 a spy one does the really cool yeah it
01:53:28.159 doesn't do the whole loop anymore right
01:53:30.320 the point uh the point is though that
01:53:32.320 the craft moved to his next location
01:53:35.440 before he knew where his next location
01:53:38.080 was gonna be jesus and
01:53:41.119 that's
01:53:42.080 i mean that's well documented
01:53:44.719 so that's uh that's a pretty shocking
01:53:47.360 piece of information what's fascinating
01:53:49.440 to me too is that you were discussing
01:53:50.880 this um the the way this reactor worked
01:53:55.040 and that these things were not really
01:53:56.560 connected
01:53:58.000 no nothing is connected
01:54:00.320 there's no wiring at all
01:54:04.880 that freaks me the [ __ ] out charge your
01:54:06.639 iphone you know yeah one wireless
01:54:08.880 yeah
01:54:09.760 yeah i mean that's the that's a simple
01:54:12.080 electromagnetic
01:54:13.599 yeah i know again but that's just simple
01:54:15.520 electromagnet magnetic induction right
01:54:17.679 but i mean tesla the scientist had this
01:54:19.599 concept of right
01:54:24.080 he wanted to send
01:54:25.599 wireless electricity through the sky and
01:54:27.760 westinghouse was like get the [ __ ] out
01:54:29.199 of here with that like when anybody
01:54:30.800 could just pull electricity out of this
01:54:32.800 meter yeah they couldn't they couldn't
01:54:34.400 just talk in the car right over and
01:54:35.760 trying to chill him out you know we're
01:54:36.960 talking about tesla and how he you know
01:54:38.719 he couldn't be metered and how it all
01:54:40.239 went down so it's funny bring it up yeah
01:54:42.239 yeah that that i mean who knows what
01:54:45.360 would have happened in terms of
01:54:46.719 innovation had he been allowed to go
01:54:48.480 forward with that well we probably
01:54:50.560 wouldn't have computers
01:54:52.159 you think
01:54:53.440 yeah i'm pretty positive i mean forget
01:54:55.440 about microelectronics well this is
01:54:57.520 dumping huge amounts of electromagnetic
01:55:00.080 energy in the air and yeah we'd be able
01:55:01.920 to wirelessly turn on our lights but
01:55:06.000 there'd be no radio communication the
01:55:07.920 interference would be something we could
01:55:09.520 would be overwhelming it would induce
01:55:11.920 electric currents in anything with a
01:55:13.760 small wire on it so integrated circuits
01:55:16.000 transistors would be disintegrated
01:55:17.840 before they were even you know tested
01:55:20.320 for operation so it it would it would
01:55:23.040 destroy [ __ ] us up yeah it would have
01:55:25.199 stopped us dead we'd have it'd be great
01:55:27.280 you could turn lighters on and heaters
01:55:29.040 from all over the place with no wires
01:55:30.719 but it would stop modern electronics and
01:55:33.040 if we became dependent on it it would
01:55:34.719 almost be like our dependence on fossil
01:55:37.119 fuels although it's destructive it's
01:55:38.800 very difficult for us to get off the
01:55:40.320 nipple
01:55:41.679 it would have changed the course of how
01:55:42.960 we developed which is so interesting
01:55:44.480 when you talk about if a civilization
01:55:46.400 another star system didn't even start
01:55:48.239 with fossil fuels they had 115 naturally
01:55:50.400 on their planet and they're like cool
01:55:51.840 anti-gravity is pretty awesome well the
01:55:53.760 fact that i think it's important that
01:55:55.440 that actually happened yeah
01:55:58.080 it might have been stopped in its tracks
01:55:59.599 for a reason
01:56:00.960 whoa
01:56:02.480 and
01:56:04.480 it's just it's i think it's incredibly
01:56:06.639 difficult for us to imagine
01:56:08.320 technological progression under another
01:56:10.239 timeline other than the one that we've
01:56:11.440 experienced yeah that's difficult
01:56:14.480 if we imagine what this
01:56:16.880 alien race must have been like and
01:56:19.280 i mean god
01:56:20.800 just just to be able to see something
01:56:23.360 take like i mean obviously we've seen it
01:56:25.040 in different life forms right like we
01:56:26.639 see the life of certain beetles in
01:56:28.560 comparison to the life of certain fish
01:56:30.719 very very different existence very
01:56:32.639 different life cycles octopus yeah
01:56:35.520 octopus yeah i mean we see all these
01:56:37.440 different variables in terms of
01:56:38.719 biological entities on earth but we
01:56:41.119 don't see it in terms of technological
01:56:42.880 innovation as we're the only one that's
01:56:45.040 intelligent that can innovate when we
01:56:47.119 have intelligent creatures but they're
01:56:48.800 in the ocean the only other thing that
01:56:50.400 are like us are dolphins and orcas and
01:56:52.000 whales and they don't have the ability
01:56:54.000 to manipulate their environment and
01:56:55.520 subsequently because they don't have the
01:56:57.360 ability to manipulate their environment
01:56:59.280 we put them in fish tanks and we're like
01:57:01.360 get in the tank do some tricks right
01:57:03.599 you know the only thing he saw in the
01:57:05.920 craft if we were considering bob's story
01:57:08.159 the only thing that you he saw in the
01:57:09.840 craft that he related to that looked
01:57:11.760 like a human could make was this
01:57:13.520 honeycomb hatch and i always loved that
01:57:15.360 because you're like obsessed with this
01:57:17.520 thing that you could recognize you know
01:57:19.199 the re yeah i i only focus on that
01:57:21.280 because it was the one thing that i
01:57:23.760 understood how it worked what was it and
01:57:25.760 it was it was the access to the level
01:57:27.679 below
01:57:28.639 and
01:57:29.599 it was um
01:57:31.679 well you know if you take uh
01:57:33.599 you have a six pack of beer and you take
01:57:35.840 out the cardboard dividers
01:57:37.679 set it on the table you can put a lot of
01:57:40.080 pressure on the top
01:57:42.400 but if you push it from the sides it
01:57:44.080 collapses flat
01:57:45.599 so it was something like that in a
01:57:47.199 honeycomb shape that was essentially
01:57:49.520 some sort of sheet metal and you could
01:57:52.719 walk on that in the upper layer but if
01:57:54.719 you took the corner stuck your finger in
01:57:57.119 and pushed it collapsed and made a
01:57:59.840 an entryway so i thought that was a
01:58:01.920 really unique i'd never seen that before
01:58:04.480 and it was the only thing in the craft
01:58:06.000 that made absolute sense to me i said ah
01:58:08.080 we can make that and all that is is a
01:58:10.480 hatchway was there any discussion about
01:58:13.119 the materials that were used to make the
01:58:15.199 craft
01:58:16.239 i'm sure there was but that was a
01:58:17.840 metallurgy division had nothing to do
01:58:19.599 with us so you never got a
01:58:22.080 not even the slightest briefing i don't
01:58:23.679 even know if it was metal or it was
01:58:25.280 ceramic it's i think it there's a fine
01:58:28.159 line between the two
01:58:30.320 now one of the things that's happened to
01:58:32.320 you that has allowed people to discredit
01:58:34.719 you was
01:58:36.159 there's obviously been some sort of an
01:58:38.480 effort to erase your past
01:58:40.800 yeah some sort of a ref uh an effort to
01:58:43.520 erase your education history your
01:58:46.000 employment history at los alamos in fact
01:58:48.719 the only way your employment history was
01:58:50.480 proven at los alamos is someone got a
01:58:52.239 list a directory of the employees from
01:58:54.639 the past
01:58:55.840 and read into it and you were on that
01:58:57.360 list so it proved that you worked there
01:58:58.960 even though people were trying to deny
01:59:00.159 and they were trying to use that as a
01:59:01.280 way to discredit you that you never did
01:59:02.800 work at los alamos you weren't really a
01:59:04.560 scientist
01:59:06.000 what was what was that like to
01:59:08.159 experience i mean of course we're
01:59:09.280 talking about the 1980s the 1990s when
01:59:12.080 you could get away with something like
01:59:13.679 that
01:59:14.960 yeah obviously there are a lot less
01:59:17.520 uh
01:59:18.719 a lot less records on computers at that
01:59:20.719 time it was still file cabinets and
01:59:22.880 folders but uh yeah that was frightening
01:59:25.599 that was one of the first things
01:59:28.960 i think it's i think george knapp was
01:59:30.719 the first one that uncovered that i mean
01:59:32.719 he saw my birth certificate disappear he
01:59:35.679 um it disappeared yeah there was no
01:59:38.080 record of you yeah there was there was
01:59:39.520 no record of that there was uh no record
01:59:42.239 his mom tells me about that like it was
01:59:44.320 frightening for her for he's got a real
01:59:46.800 family you know he's a real person it's
01:59:48.239 frightening for her
01:59:49.760 but if the los alamos thing really
01:59:51.760 surprised me and that they were so
01:59:54.159 adamant that no this guy never worked
01:59:56.159 here don't be ridiculous and george went
01:59:58.000 back and forth you know for i got the
02:00:00.000 letters on the wall yeah months i mean
02:00:02.239 it was ridiculous but fortunately
02:00:03.920 somebody came up with a 1982 phone book
02:00:06.880 directory i mean and also
02:00:09.599 uh originally i told you uh
02:00:12.960 you know when i worked there i was on
02:00:14.639 the front page of the the paper so they
02:00:16.639 were still able to archive you know
02:00:18.880 bring that back from the archives and
02:00:20.480 you know bob lazar a physicist working
02:00:22.159 here at los alamos so there was at least
02:00:24.639 something there but uh somehow george
02:00:27.599 came up with the phone director and then
02:00:29.599 george then bob took george with cameras
02:00:32.480 into los alamos oh yeah yeah so we flew
02:00:35.199 out there and i said look come on in
02:00:37.280 i'll show you where i worked we'll go in
02:00:39.280 we'll meet people and george went with
02:00:41.119 me and you know
02:00:43.040 i navigate the place oh yeah and you
02:00:44.960 know met people and you know and almost
02:00:47.760 was also the place where they had the
02:00:50.719 machine that was able to read the the
02:00:53.199 size of your digits no no that wasn't
02:00:55.520 awesome that was s4 that was s4 and
02:00:57.760 explain that
02:00:59.440 so
02:01:00.320 now this was back in the 80s and this is
02:01:02.239 back in the 80s where when you discuss
02:01:04.400 this people like this doesn't even exist
02:01:06.800 yeah okay what was it it was a way
02:01:09.840 you know this is before fingerprint
02:01:11.119 scanners and
02:01:12.480 you know and anything of
02:01:15.599 anything any high resolution scanner at
02:01:17.599 that time so what it was was a device
02:01:19.840 that uh had a little picture of a hand
02:01:22.239 on a glass plate with pins in it so you
02:01:24.880 could jam your hand in there and there
02:01:26.880 was a bright light above it and a sensor
02:01:28.880 underneath and when you put your hand in
02:01:31.440 there the light would turn on and it
02:01:33.520 would measure the bones in your finger
02:01:36.000 because the light shown through your
02:01:37.599 bones
02:01:38.639 and apparently
02:01:41.679 the length of the bones in your fingers
02:01:43.440 are extremely unique and easy to measure
02:01:46.080 and they use that when you put your
02:01:48.239 hands on there the light would turn on
02:01:49.760 and your badge would pop out there's it
02:01:51.520 right oh there it is that's that's it
02:01:53.520 and i tried to describe this um to
02:01:55.760 people and they said that is the most
02:01:57.599 ridiculous thing we've ever heard
02:01:59.679 and um
02:02:00.960 i said hey that my badge came out of
02:02:02.960 that thing i put my hand on it badge
02:02:05.119 popped out and that's how i could open
02:02:06.639 the doors and get into s4
02:02:08.560 and um you know and everybody
02:02:10.719 discredited that they said it was
02:02:12.000 [ __ ] it was science fiction and
02:02:13.760 jeremy you found this
02:02:15.760 i i found it through a good friend of
02:02:17.520 mine named tyler rogoway and he had some
02:02:19.440 good sources inside of area 52 where
02:02:21.679 they also used these for the stealth
02:02:24.080 program right around that time so now
02:02:26.320 i've got all these people that worked
02:02:27.599 within who you know said only if you're
02:02:30.400 in certain programs would we use this
02:02:32.320 technology it's kind of [ __ ] actually
02:02:33.599 they didn't keep it for very long
02:02:34.800 beginning of biometrics so i was able to
02:02:36.719 reveal it in my film i kept my mouth
02:02:38.719 shut until i showed it to bob you know
02:02:41.280 the movie is the first time he saw it
02:02:43.040 was how you see it in the documentary
02:02:44.639 that's his genuine reaction i'm getting
02:02:46.080 goosebumps that was a great idea the way
02:02:47.840 you did it thank you man because you
02:02:49.040 know what guess what i'm actually trying
02:02:50.560 to see if he's telling the truth that's
02:02:52.320 how i started you know that's how i
02:02:53.840 started so it was really cool to see
02:02:55.199 that that you get to see it his actual
02:02:57.760 reaction has that been verified by other
02:03:00.159 people yeah so
02:03:01.840 yeah so to me it has uh personally i get
02:03:04.880 emails every day and people are telling
02:03:06.400 me where these are used and how they're
02:03:08.080 used and send me photos i got a lot of
02:03:09.760 photos of identity mats now well how
02:03:11.280 they were used right they're not how
02:03:12.719 they were used yeah but uh i don't the
02:03:15.040 most recent one was
02:03:16.800 way more recent than i thought in
02:03:18.159 another country but yeah that technology
02:03:20.159 was used so what's so funny is
02:03:23.280 um
02:03:24.239 that this technology even in the area 52
02:03:28.080 where they'd use him for tonopah one of
02:03:29.679 the guys who will go on camera with me
02:03:31.679 he will do an interview with me he was a
02:03:33.920 technician for one of these and and he
02:03:36.000 hated them because they were really bad
02:03:37.840 they always broke down and never and he
02:03:39.920 was a technician for him now he won't
02:03:41.679 tell me where if he worked at area 52 so
02:03:44.320 it's probably tonopah
02:03:46.000 it's very separated even on base but
02:03:48.000 yeah so
02:03:49.440 there was that yeah there is your
02:03:52.480 education record that was also like what
02:03:55.280 happened with that
02:03:57.679 well that disappeared also you know that
02:04:00.000 i i've i've never gone
02:04:02.800 i've never gone anywhere for education
02:04:05.679 i've never gone i never attended any
02:04:07.760 classes at caltech i never attended
02:04:09.520 anything at mit
02:04:11.760 you did attend classes in those places i
02:04:14.000 did attend classes in those places do
02:04:15.760 you know anybody that you went to school
02:04:17.280 with
02:04:18.159 yes i do and have they verified that
02:04:20.400 they went to school with you well i gave
02:04:21.920 jeremy some names but people yeah i the
02:04:24.719 reason i don't say these names publicly
02:04:27.360 is because every single time i mention a
02:04:30.239 name somebody gets injured they don't
02:04:32.320 want to be of course yeah yeah of course
02:04:36.080 um but what what is that experience like
02:04:38.400 seeing your birth certificate erased
02:04:41.040 seeing your employment well it's
02:04:43.040 frightening it's it's absolutely
02:04:45.119 frightening it's also the fuel that the
02:04:46.880 debunkers use the so-called air quote
02:04:49.119 skeptics i don't like the term skeptics
02:04:51.760 i'm going to say this publicly because i
02:04:53.040 really only said this privately i think
02:04:54.800 it's a sloppy lazy way to look at things
02:04:57.760 to just be a skeptic
02:05:00.080 i want people to be objective
02:05:02.320 and i think there's a lot of things you
02:05:04.639 should be skeptical of i think you
02:05:07.040 should you should look at things and
02:05:09.440 look at things
02:05:11.119 from a hard-line science perspective you
02:05:13.679 should be subjective but the idea of
02:05:15.840 skeptics the problem with that is you're
02:05:17.440 always looking for things to be [ __ ]
02:05:19.280 yeah and i think that's dangerous
02:05:20.880 because i think some things aren't
02:05:22.239 [ __ ] it's confirmation bias on the
02:05:23.840 other end you're just deciding to take a
02:05:25.360 square thing and put it around hold no
02:05:26.880 matter what and i find a lot of them to
02:05:29.119 be lazy
02:05:30.239 a lot of them to be lazy thinkers sure
02:05:32.080 because they're always putting it into
02:05:33.840 that box instead of going hmm
02:05:36.480 instead of just separating their ego
02:05:38.400 they're trying they're playing a game
02:05:40.080 and the game is calling [ __ ] i want
02:05:42.159 to call [ __ ] and i'm gonna line up
02:05:44.239 all these reasons why it's [ __ ] and
02:05:45.920 i'm gonna ignore anything that might be
02:05:47.679 contrary to that definition yeah
02:05:50.000 every time i'm thinking i'm going to
02:05:51.280 catch him in something you know all
02:05:52.880 along this process um i found dr krangle
02:05:55.440 he came forward and said i was in
02:05:56.639 security briefings with bob lazar the
02:05:58.480 physicist at los angeles he went on the
02:06:00.400 record with me now the other people i
02:06:02.159 talked with why won't they go on the
02:06:03.679 record with me because they're still
02:06:05.280 working there
02:06:07.040 so that that's the difference right what
02:06:08.480 is that what can the public have right
02:06:10.239 or even if they're not working there
02:06:11.520 that you know they want to live their
02:06:12.719 lives why i mean obviously people have
02:06:14.560 seen what's happened to you mike thigpen
02:06:17.840 after 30 years yeah really if you look
02:06:20.320 at all the information on
02:06:23.040 you know concerning my accounts that's
02:06:25.599 that's verifiable
02:06:27.520 it can't possibly be a [ __ ] story
02:06:30.159 anymore it's really way past that point
02:06:32.800 yeah i mean that was my big pin is i
02:06:35.440 mean how could i possibly know
02:06:38.560 uh so mike fig pin
02:06:40.800 was the guy that did the security
02:06:42.800 clearances to go to the bait one of the
02:06:44.880 guys that was this is the guy that you
02:06:46.159 worked with he said he did
02:06:48.239 right and and george knapp you know
02:06:50.400 george didn't believe him george put him
02:06:52.000 through four polygraph tests right he
02:06:54.480 tried to see man this is a big risk it
02:06:56.960 sounds interesting but let's see if he's
02:06:58.800 telling the truth one of the things was
02:07:01.440 bob said there's a guy named mike
02:07:02.560 thigpen he did security clearances for
02:07:04.159 the base and that's a weird name it's
02:07:06.480 very specific
02:07:07.920 for 30 years george
02:07:10.239 found this guy in this weird department
02:07:12.000 that he didn't even know it was my big
02:07:13.520 pin the guy wouldn't talk to me ghosted
02:07:15.360 him totally ghosting for 30 years used
02:07:17.360 facebook and google image match through
02:07:19.360 his children i was able to find him
02:07:21.360 after 30 years and i talked to him three
02:07:23.599 times on the phone he lives on the east
02:07:25.520 coast he almost went on camera with me
02:07:28.159 confirmed that he did security
02:07:29.520 clearances for the base in 1989
02:07:31.599 confirmed he remembers bob lazar and
02:07:34.159 what you don't know is there's a
02:07:35.520 handwritten note that a friend of yours
02:07:37.520 has from mike what i know i'm gonna give
02:07:40.239 it to you later i don't but that is real
02:07:42.000 that is actual so a handwritten note
02:07:43.520 that says what you know like this is new
02:07:45.040 to me so when the i
02:07:47.599 when you're
02:07:50.480 when they do security client clearances
02:07:52.480 they go through all your friends and
02:07:53.920 they go to your friend's phone yeah yeah
02:07:55.199 so this is too bob and
02:07:57.840 i had people come to me for a friend of
02:07:59.280 mine that's serving and they're doing
02:08:00.719 the security clearance for him and even
02:08:02.079 though i'm like the ufo guy
02:08:04.239 they did you know the fbi come and visit
02:08:06.159 my house and make sure that they talk
02:08:08.000 about my friend and they lift a little
02:08:09.920 card and when my wife told him to get
02:08:11.920 away because he didn't know who they
02:08:12.960 were they left a little card it's super
02:08:14.800 cute now back then it was a handwritten
02:08:16.960 note and his friend has it for him that
02:08:18.800 you haven't seen in oh my god two
02:08:21.280 decades
02:08:22.639 so if you're listening
02:08:24.079 you're telling me what it is
02:08:25.760 what is this card
02:08:27.280 it's just a little handwritten note with
02:08:28.960 mike thigpen's signature card like like
02:08:31.280 a like a postcard
02:08:32.960 like a piece of paper that he left on
02:08:34.719 the door saying when bob gets back or
02:08:36.639 whatever it says on it so it's just
02:08:38.639 another little funny thing i found the
02:08:40.400 guy he does the security clearances he
02:08:42.079 admitted to me he did it and he admitted
02:08:43.760 to me he was dodging george knapp
02:08:45.280 because when george said his name on the
02:08:46.719 writ on the on the news he dropped his
02:08:49.280 fork into his steak or into his potatoes
02:08:51.360 or whatever and he's looking at his wife
02:08:53.280 he was in trouble his name's never
02:08:54.800 supposed to be out there like it's just
02:08:56.079 a security clearance guy but you don't
02:08:57.840 want national attention associated with
02:09:00.079 anything bob has to say but anyway this
02:09:02.480 unique name bob said for 30 years and
02:09:05.280 the guy ghosted george knapp george
02:09:06.719 could prove he existed he actually
02:09:08.639 talked to me man he talked to me three
02:09:10.239 times he almost went on camera with me
02:09:12.800 it's just crazy what what do you what
02:09:14.400 happens after 30 years you just get more
02:09:16.159 info well that's one of the reasons why
02:09:18.880 when you and me and jeremy and george
02:09:22.560 knapp had that conversation on the phone
02:09:24.560 yeah i said i think
02:09:26.880 what we can do
02:09:28.480 with this podcast
02:09:30.239 is important i really do i think it's
02:09:33.199 important for people to hear this
02:09:35.760 from you in a very clear
02:09:39.440 just very concise way
02:09:43.119 and if you examine all the information
02:09:46.239 that you've said today if you you look
02:09:48.239 at all the things that the detractors
02:09:49.920 have said if you look at all of the new
02:09:52.639 recent evidence that's coming out and
02:09:54.639 all these
02:09:56.400 really high-level people in the military
02:09:58.560 and the government that are discussing
02:10:00.000 this
02:10:01.280 it gives you
02:10:03.760 far more credibility than you would have
02:10:06.320 had in the 19 years when this came out
02:10:09.360 [ __ ] yes you can't ignore his story just
02:10:12.079 because you don't like it anymore that's
02:10:13.840 why i thought it was important that you
02:10:15.040 come out and refresh the world's memory
02:10:17.679 and let people know and like i said i've
02:10:19.679 been i mean i want to say i'm a fan of
02:10:21.520 yours but i guess i'm a fan of yours as
02:10:23.280 a human being i'm a fan of yours but
02:10:25.040 i've been following you for decades i've
02:10:27.199 been following the story for decades i
02:10:28.800 mean i'm kidding i have vhs tapes bob
02:10:31.440 like a lot of the world has yeah it's
02:10:33.760 crazy well anybody that has any sort of
02:10:36.800 uh a vested interest or a just a even uh
02:10:40.719 just a fascination with ufos has
02:10:43.599 followed your story because there's no
02:10:46.480 one else there's no one else that comes
02:10:48.719 for this some guy who said i worked
02:10:50.560 underground with the aliens they shot my
02:10:52.000 hand off like there's a bunch of wacky
02:10:53.599 dudes
02:10:54.560 they're underground there's bases
02:10:55.840 they're shooting lasers through the
02:10:56.800 earth's crust and they move them at
02:10:58.239 light speed there's a lot of those guys
02:11:00.639 they seem schizophrenic they seem crazy
02:11:02.560 they might even be disinformation agents
02:11:04.719 they might be people that are designed
02:11:06.639 to muddy the waters which for sure has
02:11:09.119 happened people are coming forward
02:11:10.719 though now it's amazing by doing this
02:11:12.560 what you're doing you're providing an
02:11:13.920 opportunity for bob to tell a story you
02:11:16.000 know believe it or not he can tell a
02:11:18.000 story it's amazing because more people
02:11:20.560 will come forward now
02:11:22.400 that are involved with these projects
02:11:24.639 they'll come forward to you to me
02:11:26.159 they're coming forward and so what
02:11:27.520 you've done here is provide that
02:11:28.719 opportunity if they need it and it's
02:11:30.880 amazing i just want to say bob just
02:11:32.560 don't come forward no don't come forward
02:11:34.560 to bob
02:11:36.800 why were you freaking nauseous at the
02:11:39.280 beginning of this like so
02:11:41.440 upset why was your why'd you have a
02:11:43.199 migraine because that started off so
02:11:44.560 hard my god i was sitting here like did
02:11:45.760 this why are you asking him why because
02:11:47.760 obviously anxiety the guy's gone through
02:11:49.760 30 [ __ ] years of being persecuted i
02:11:51.679 just want to erase his birth certificate
02:11:53.280 i just want to hear what you hear from i
02:11:54.639 want to hear him say i want them why did
02:11:56.320 i have to say that you don't just set it
02:11:58.159 up get it i step out okay settle down
02:12:02.639 yeah well i get it you were it was hard
02:12:04.960 for you to get them here you know and i
02:12:06.400 was for us yeah you you don't you do
02:12:09.599 what really annoys me are the people
02:12:11.119 that think you know you guys just came
02:12:13.360 up with the story to make a bunch of
02:12:14.639 money or get a bunch of you know
02:12:16.079 attention and that's a good point so
02:12:17.760 please explain that first of all i don't
02:12:19.679 get any money out of this at all and i
02:12:21.920 may i didn't even let you guys buy plane
02:12:24.239 tickets for me to come out here or
02:12:25.679 anything i mean
02:12:27.360 any time like when jeremy
02:12:30.239 uh pre-previewed i guess the movie up in
02:12:33.520 michigan
02:12:34.480 i mean they it brought in like a couple
02:12:36.480 thousand dollars i made sure that two
02:12:38.159 thousand dollars went to science
02:12:40.239 programs at the local high schools there
02:12:42.560 dirty money i don't want to touch it i
02:12:44.320 don't take any money from this stuff and
02:12:46.000 as far as attention
02:12:48.000 i hate [ __ ] attention i don't like
02:12:51.920 being on shows i just want to kind of
02:12:54.000 hide in the corner and do my own thing
02:12:55.840 so that's i got enough hugs when i was a
02:12:57.840 kid okay i don't need any attention so
02:13:01.199 now that if if you if you think somehow
02:13:04.320 we came up with this thing then you got
02:13:06.000 to tell me why we did it well you've
02:13:08.239 done a great job of
02:13:10.000 making sure you have your bases covered
02:13:11.760 in that regard that you haven't profited
02:13:13.360 off of this and like you said that you
02:13:14.560 have donated whatever money that came
02:13:16.159 your way to science programs it's i mean
02:13:18.719 it it doesn't make any sense
02:13:21.760 any other way
02:13:23.199 i mean what you're what i've gotten out
02:13:25.440 of here is what i thought i was going to
02:13:27.440 get out of here when i watched the
02:13:28.480 documentary that you what you're saying
02:13:30.800 makes sense it doesn't make sense that
02:13:32.960 it's [ __ ] that happened exactly like
02:13:35.199 i said it did joe i believe you
02:13:37.920 um in closing is there anything else
02:13:40.239 you'd like to say
02:13:42.960 no i can't think of anything other than
02:13:44.719 really don't come and try to visit me
02:13:47.190 [Laughter]
02:13:48.960 well um i know that you have paid a huge
02:13:52.320 personal cost to get this information
02:13:54.639 out and i mean maybe you didn't
02:13:56.480 understand what that cost would have
02:13:57.679 been when you first initially came
02:13:59.440 forward with the story but over the past
02:14:01.840 30 years it's been immense it's been
02:14:04.079 great and i just want to thank you for
02:14:05.920 that and thank you for all these people
02:14:08.159 that would not have gotten this
02:14:09.440 information and would not have really
02:14:11.199 had this story any other way
02:14:13.599 oh thanks joe thank you
02:14:15.440 and thank you jeremy and one more time
02:14:17.199 the documentary is available on netflix
