00:00:07.919 well as far as the alien bible i don't
00:00:09.679 know
00:00:10.480 what you're really talking about some of
00:00:11.920 the briefings that i read dealt with
00:00:14.080 some of the information about uh you
00:00:16.400 know as being the product of a genetic
00:00:18.880 modification right but
00:00:21.039 that's about all
00:00:23.119 that's about all that i know
00:00:24.480 repercussions the big story all that
00:00:26.880 and all that i really have an idea about
00:00:28.720 well i meant like you mentioned a date
00:00:30.800 when they were supposed to return is
00:00:32.238 something supposed to happen when they
00:00:33.520 return
00:00:35.120 i have no idea it was just a date
00:00:37.840 and uh it was it was a number that made
00:00:40.000 no sense to me it was a
00:00:42.079 601 or 300 something you know obviously
00:00:44.960 in a different numerical system
00:00:47.760 and so other than having created this
00:00:49.840 and then the genetic upgrades because
00:00:51.920 that's it as far as supposedly if that
00:00:54.239 information is correct
00:00:59.680 uh i'm interested a little bit more
00:01:01.280 about the physics of the power
00:01:03.120 generation
00:01:04.879 from the development of the antimatter
00:01:07.920 to
00:01:08.250 [Music]
00:01:09.439 to the gravity a wave and amplification
00:01:12.560 and that process
00:01:14.159 of the generation of that
00:01:16.880 and being able to follow space
00:01:22.320 that's a pretty lengthy explanation
00:01:25.280 in other words the relationship between
00:01:26.479 the development of the antimatter and
00:01:27.920 the gravitational force field
00:01:32.560 well it's i can
00:01:34.560 give you i guess a brief overview of
00:01:37.119 essentially how that works if you want
00:01:38.799 an in-depth
00:01:40.479 description of that you can give me your
00:01:42.159 address and i can send you a paper on it
00:01:45.840 essentially what the reactor does
00:01:48.880 is
00:01:51.840 provide electrical power and the base
00:01:53.759 gravity wave to amplify and it does that
00:01:56.719 by
00:01:57.759 interacting matter and antimatter
00:01:59.520 essentially
00:02:01.119 the way it does that is
00:02:03.680 injecting an accelerated proton into a
00:02:06.640 piece of 115 that spontaneously
00:02:08.959 generates
00:02:10.479 any hydrogen essentially
00:02:12.800 that's reacted
00:02:14.400 in a
00:02:17.520 a small area it's a compressed gas
00:02:19.920 probably compressed atmospheric gas and
00:02:23.680 the antimatter reacting
00:02:25.520 with matter produces the energy
00:02:28.480 mainly heat energy and that is converted
00:02:30.239 into electrical energy by a thermionic
00:02:32.160 generator that appear to be 100
00:02:34.480 efficient
00:02:36.560 which is you know a difficult concept
00:02:39.280 to believe anyway uh also the reactor
00:02:42.239 has two functions that's one of them the
00:02:43.680 other function is
00:02:45.680 it provides the basic
00:02:47.440 gravity wave that's amplified and that
00:02:49.920 appears at the upper sphere
00:02:52.319 of the amplifier itself and that's
00:02:54.000 tapped off with a waveguide similar to
00:02:55.760 microwaves
00:02:56.959 and uh
00:02:58.159 is amplified
00:03:01.120 and focused essentially
00:03:11.680 essentially without wires and i related
00:03:13.760 it to almost a tesla setup it seemed
00:03:16.080 like each subcomponent on the craft was
00:03:18.400 attuned
00:03:19.519 to the frequency that the reactor was
00:03:21.519 operating at so essentially the
00:03:23.599 amplifiers themselves receive the
00:03:25.760 electrical energy like a tesla coil
00:03:27.840 transmits power to uh you know
00:03:29.920 fluorescent two
00:03:32.879 and uh
00:03:34.799 what was the rest of the question
00:03:38.000 what is the relationship between i think
00:03:39.599 that's you basically answered yeah
00:03:41.440 that's that's how the amplifiers receive
00:03:43.280 the power through the waveguide to
00:03:44.480 receive the basic wave it's almost it's
00:03:46.959 very very similar to a microwave
00:03:48.560 amplifier
00:03:49.680 and uh you know for more technical
00:03:51.599 description and i can send you drawings
00:03:53.599 or things along those lines but
00:03:55.760 that's basically how it works
00:03:58.640 i understand you took someone 115 home
00:04:01.120 with you
00:04:02.080 to uh do some testing on your own
00:04:04.560 i obtained it yeah
00:04:06.159 did you
00:04:07.200 document any of your testing yeah you
00:04:09.360 did
00:04:10.799 yeah the video mostly video tape and
00:04:12.560 things like that john said it was stolen
00:04:14.480 from you later last night he said they
00:04:16.478 stole it back
00:04:17.600 he said
00:04:18.880 well there's another level to that but
00:04:21.040 like i said right now it's in private
00:04:22.720 hands okay
00:04:26.720 element 115 um
00:04:29.520 john said last night that a piece a
00:04:31.280 wedge that's about two inches in length
00:04:34.000 on the ship up to 30 years how does that
00:04:36.320 go in like
00:04:40.560 well it really depends on the energy
00:04:42.080 level though the more energy you expend
00:04:44.960 the uh you know greater consumption of
00:04:46.560 fuel just like in any any modern machine
00:04:48.880 so
00:04:49.919 it really really all depends on the
00:04:51.759 amount of energy you requested
00:04:56.000 does dr keller's relationship ask for do
00:04:58.560 you think he might be working on
00:05:00.160 antimatter weaponry
00:05:03.199 i don't know but he was certainly uh
00:05:06.880 i forgot what his exact title was he was
00:05:09.120 chief consultant or something along
00:05:10.720 those lines
00:05:12.320 and as far as any amount of weaponry i
00:05:14.320 don't i don't think anyone was involved
00:05:16.080 in that certainly some
00:05:18.560 beam weapon work and you know teller has
00:05:20.720 been involved with that
00:05:23.039 i think his last project
00:05:25.039 livermore los alamos was um
00:05:27.840 i think he called it super excalibur and
00:05:29.759 that was essentially a uh
00:05:31.840 nuclear bomb detonated in orbit and
00:05:34.080 fiber optic light guides that directed
00:05:36.000 x-rays to uh incoming warheads and uh
00:05:39.440 that's his pet project he loves that
00:05:41.440 thing so i don't think he jumped to uh
00:05:43.840 any matter weapon
00:05:46.880 all the way in the back there
00:05:50.960 you think was on uh three and where was
00:05:53.039 the bathroom
00:05:56.720 i don't know if anything was on level
00:05:58.400 well i don't know if there were any
00:05:59.440 bathrooms on level three i can only
00:06:01.360 guess and i would imagine that there was
00:06:03.840 some sort of navigational equipment or
00:06:05.680 their version of a computer or something
00:06:07.280 along those lines because i saw nothing
00:06:09.120 else that uh
00:06:10.800 controlled
00:06:12.080 the uh the amplifiers the directions
00:06:14.080 they pointed at
00:06:17.199 bob how do you perceive that mankind can
00:06:18.960 develop this title for
00:06:20.960 rashima
00:06:24.160 uh i really don't
00:06:27.360 i really don't without access to certain
00:06:29.039 materials
00:06:30.560 or maybe new manufacturing techniques
00:06:32.479 that can produce those but until those
00:06:34.479 problems are solved you know the fact
00:06:36.400 that we even know how to how to deal
00:06:37.759 with it or even duplicate it uh
00:06:41.199 you know it's pretty useless
00:06:43.120 how many other materials might be
00:06:44.720 necessary uh besides 115 that you know
00:06:48.479 that we're contained on the ship that
00:06:50.319 might be it but
00:06:51.520 the rest of it might be just uh
00:06:54.479 essentially
00:06:55.919 polishing out manufacturing techniques
00:06:57.919 making things smaller you know just
00:06:59.360 general increase in technology getting a
00:07:02.000 a small accelerator running at a higher
00:07:04.639 energy level
00:07:06.160 i don't know about the
00:07:07.759 metallurgy aspect of the craft i don't
00:07:09.599 think any exotic metals are necessary
00:07:11.360 though they may be employed
00:07:14.319 i don't i imagine you could make a craft
00:07:16.720 out of aluminum if necessary
00:07:18.960 but uh what part that plays i i don't
00:07:21.520 know
00:07:23.360 is there any significance to the saucer
00:07:26.000 shape the geometry having to do with any
00:07:27.840 resonance or anything of that nature not
00:07:29.840 any resonance but it's important most of
00:07:31.440 the edges on the craft are rounded
00:07:32.880 because a high voltage feel does appear
00:07:35.199 at most of the craft except for the
00:07:37.039 upper
00:07:37.919 the last upper bump there's a little
00:07:39.599 ring before that now i'm only talking
00:07:41.039 about one craft so i don't know about
00:07:42.400 the rest but there's a small ring before
00:07:44.960 that a darker black one and that's an
00:07:46.639 insulator ring and that's the only place
00:07:48.720 above that that upper section the third
00:07:50.800 level is where high voltage does not
00:07:52.800 appear
00:07:55.440 did any technology that came from the
00:07:57.360 aliens resemble anything that we can do
00:07:59.199 today
00:08:00.639 but we advance to any degree that
00:08:03.680 they are
00:08:06.000 well there are some basic
00:08:08.319 things
00:08:10.240 the fact that they're using a little
00:08:11.520 accelerator with smaller you know we
00:08:13.360 have things like that if that's what
00:08:14.800 you're getting at
00:08:17.599 anything really advanced
00:08:20.160 uh
00:08:21.120 well as far as controlling gravity waves
00:08:24.319 yeah other than the fact that just the
00:08:25.840 way the craft operates
00:08:28.240 you know by manipulating gravity that's
00:08:31.199 that's about it really
00:08:34.880 so i'm going to ask you
00:08:36.880 talking about metal version
00:08:38.958 what you observed in terms of uh
00:08:42.159 the structure the skin of it thickness
00:08:44.399 because you know there were reports from
00:08:46.240 roswell
00:08:47.519 other where that there was a very thin
00:08:50.160 type of metal skin that was really
00:08:52.440 undamageable and so on
00:08:54.480 what was this construction
00:08:57.200 well i called it metal and uh i really
00:09:00.320 can't say that's what it was i called it
00:09:02.160 metal because i slid my hand across it
00:09:04.880 and it was cold and it was semi you know
00:09:07.360 lustrous so did you notice any place
00:09:09.120 like where you're on an edge or
00:09:10.240 something where it may have been a lot
00:09:11.680 thinner than your standard metal
00:09:14.080 or balloon
00:09:15.200 aircraft it's hard from the outside you
00:09:16.959 can't tell when you walk in
00:09:18.800 the way the
00:09:21.600 the way the archways are inside
00:09:24.480 they're probably about uh four inches
00:09:26.640 thick anyway so you really can't tell
00:09:28.160 how thin
00:09:29.360 the uh the skin is itself or if it's
00:09:31.360 exotic
00:09:34.640 yes more on this element 115
00:09:37.360 and your contention that it couldn't be
00:09:39.040 made here on earth
00:09:42.000 what if we found the right bombardment
00:09:44.720 speed the right target shape and the
00:09:46.640 right containment
00:09:48.880 well i imagine
00:09:50.399 with enough time you can make a small
00:09:52.320 amount of it i mean
00:09:54.080 my analogy is look at uh
00:09:56.560 you know look at how long it takes to
00:09:57.680 make gold an accelerator from bismuth or
00:09:59.600 something like that um that may just be
00:10:01.760 a technology that hasn't advanced far
00:10:04.000 enough
00:10:06.640 right but the bottom line is you have to
00:10:09.360 sit there and plug in
00:10:12.240 protons
00:10:13.760 and neutrons with that matter into an
00:10:15.600 existing atom and you have to do it you
00:10:17.600 know essentially on an individual basis
00:10:19.680 and they're not all going to catch on
00:10:21.040 and so we're going to
00:10:22.560 but how did how do you think they got
00:10:24.720 their first piece of it if it was in a
00:10:27.440 dead star how
00:10:28.959 uh going from i think it was naturally
00:10:30.959 occurring somewhere on their just
00:10:32.720 because it's stable yeah probably some
00:10:36.320 that's just a guess on my part but uh
00:10:40.320 you know if that technology was
00:10:41.680 harnessed quick enough
00:10:43.360 chances are they didn't have uh you know
00:10:45.760 when they came here our levels of
00:10:47.760 technology were probably fairly new to
00:10:49.440 them they've probably never even
00:10:50.480 considered an internal combustion
00:10:51.920 engineer for that matter
00:10:53.839 you know when they came flying into the
00:10:55.440 atmosphere and saw a little cigar shaped
00:10:57.200 things with fire coming out the back
00:10:58.560 they probably couldn't conceive of how
00:10:59.839 they were powered so it was uh
00:11:02.079 you know
00:11:03.360 it just all depends how you know what
00:11:06.000 materials raw materials you have
00:11:08.880 but you know that's just an opinion that
00:11:10.320 that was a natural agreement
00:11:17.120 as of the time that i was there i was
00:11:18.800 told that they didn't they really didn't
00:11:20.720 take them any great distance at all
00:11:22.240 other than right outside uh
00:11:30.880 if we had a working agreement with the
00:11:32.480 aliens at one time
00:11:34.240 um
00:11:35.279 why didn't they give us a user's manual
00:11:37.200 for these shifts why have we had to work
00:11:38.640 for hardback engineering i uh the
00:11:40.800 slightest idea
00:11:43.680 with any of the technology
00:11:45.519 i i really don't know
00:11:47.360 you know
00:11:48.240 it almost seems like there has been some
00:11:50.079 assistance or some information found but
00:11:53.680 but who knows your information
00:11:57.920 yeah uh with such tight security around
00:12:00.320 there's supposedly only
00:12:01.839 500 pounds of this material how is it
00:12:04.800 somebody can get some of it out of this
00:12:07.519 because some of them not some of the
00:12:09.120 material the material is
00:12:11.120 that they have there is essentially raw
00:12:14.399 the material is
00:12:16.079 it has to be machined into disks these
00:12:18.639 discs have to be stacked up and then cut
00:12:20.560 into a cone shape and then sliced
00:12:23.830 [Music]
00:12:25.200 along the long axis of it
00:12:27.120 that work is done at los alamos
00:12:30.320 i don't i'm not exactly sure no loss
00:12:31.760 almost knows what they're doing uh
00:12:33.760 apparently they think that they're
00:12:35.279 developing
00:12:36.720 the little coins they're working on is
00:12:38.639 some new type of armor
00:12:40.399 and uh having worked at los alamos and
00:12:42.880 no people
00:12:44.000 around that area that's i obtained some
00:12:46.320 of it
00:12:48.959 can you say anything about
00:12:50.839 project looking glass and relationship
00:12:53.600 between gravity and time
00:12:55.920 well gravity and time are almost
00:12:57.440 essentially the same thing
00:12:59.760 and looking glass dealt with using
00:13:01.680 gravity essentially to distort time and
00:13:05.120 as i've said before i really know very
00:13:06.720 little about that but you know they're
00:13:08.160 only talking talking about milliseconds
00:13:10.240 or even less microseconds of
00:13:12.800 time distortion they're not like looking
00:13:14.720 back in time to see who killed kennedy
00:13:16.800 or something
00:13:21.680 the uh the crap that you are you talking
00:13:23.760 about the scout craft is that the one
00:13:25.200 that's like the damn ski picture with
00:13:26.959 the three
00:13:27.920 domes underneath and if it's not i'm not
00:13:30.560 exactly sure what the dam's okay this
00:13:32.839 is
00:13:34.480 this is the one that uh
00:13:36.720 looks like a my one of the mirecraft
00:13:40.800 did you see
00:13:42.160 any others than that one or is there
00:13:44.320 nine up there yeah i saw nine total but
00:13:46.399 that's the only one i got close enough
00:13:47.839 to do you see one of the three domes
00:13:49.760 underneath that uh
00:13:51.519 three balls underneath that has the
00:13:52.880 central housing underneath and then the
00:13:54.959 second question was um did anybody give
00:13:57.760 you any indication as to who was driving
00:13:59.920 or any information on that
00:14:03.199 i assume that it was humans that were
00:14:05.279 violating the craft so it could have
00:14:07.440 been remote control but at the one test
00:14:09.120 flight that i saw on the ground uh
00:14:11.760 they were in radio communication with
00:14:13.360 someone and i assumed it was someone in
00:14:15.199 the craft
00:14:16.800 i mentioned it's possible that it could
00:14:18.320 have been a remote observer somewhere
00:14:19.839 but uh
00:14:21.199 and i just assumed that the seats were
00:14:22.560 retrofitted or they were sitting on the
00:14:24.560 floor for that matter
00:14:29.040 are you familiar with a couple uh
00:14:31.600 aspects of the question are you familiar
00:14:33.279 with howard menger's electrocraft
00:14:35.680 and uh otis cars
00:14:38.079 saucer design and how are those
00:14:40.480 how are their devices
00:14:42.560 how do they generate their gravity
00:14:44.160 fields
00:14:45.199 and compared with what you've described
00:14:47.519 and lastly
00:14:49.440 can you
00:14:50.320 can you speculate how the
00:14:52.959 why the commercialization of some of
00:14:54.639 these crafts hasn't been possible with
00:14:56.639 so many different patents applied for
00:14:59.920 these kinds of design
00:15:01.839 because they don't work
00:15:06.160 are there any g-forces encountered by
00:15:08.560 the products inside the crack
00:15:10.480 no no
00:15:12.560 um from your interviews you seem to feel
00:15:14.639 that the
00:15:16.000 area 51 or the escort test site was kind
00:15:19.120 of slip shot and how it how it does its
00:15:22.079 research it really doesn't have
00:15:24.160 the facilities there to actually do the
00:15:26.000 research correctly and also i wonder
00:15:28.320 could you comment about that and also
00:15:29.680 i'm wondering what you can tell us about
00:15:31.360 the other types of ships you saw there
00:15:33.279 that you thought were alien in origin
00:15:37.600 well the
00:15:38.800 as far as the research at s4 that was
00:15:40.800 kind of slip shot
00:15:43.600 just because mainly it was being done
00:15:45.360 from a military point of view
00:15:48.800 if anything
00:15:50.399 it was a weapons development program and
00:15:53.440 they were more concerned about
00:15:54.800 duplicating the technology not really
00:15:56.959 duplicating the technology duplicating
00:15:58.560 the hardware as opposed to back
00:16:00.320 engineering the technology to find out
00:16:02.480 how these theories actually work
00:16:04.639 and
00:16:05.759 you know what's going on with them and
00:16:08.480 so they really weren't taking the
00:16:09.600 scientific approach and that was causing
00:16:12.320 some dissension
00:16:14.399 uh i don't remember the second part of
00:16:16.320 the question um just what other types of
00:16:18.399 ships did you see that might have been
00:16:19.839 alien in origin
00:16:22.240 i only saw them and they buried in shape
00:16:25.279 and i was told they had the same
00:16:26.880 identical
00:16:28.160 power and propulsion system
00:16:30.079 and that's the extent of my knowledge on
00:16:31.600 them
00:16:33.600 they vary completely in shape
00:16:55.680 well they really didn't talk about the
00:16:57.279 aliens uh
00:16:59.839 the only time i ever heard anybody
00:17:02.000 mention anything about an alien someone
00:17:04.640 and i'm just assuming that someone
00:17:06.480 called it or called
00:17:08.559 the thing a gourd
00:17:10.959 and that was that was it i heard it in
00:17:12.880 the middle of a conversation and they
00:17:14.240 stopped talking when i got up so
00:17:29.360 how about consoles or displays
00:17:32.640 nothing along those lines but
00:17:34.400 what i call the console there are three
00:17:36.240 seats
00:17:39.120 if you look at the bottom level there's
00:17:40.559 a three amplifiers in a triad
00:17:43.120 formation directly above each one is
00:17:45.840 something i call a console and i think
00:17:47.600 that's
00:17:48.640 a secondary part to the amplifier and an
00:17:51.200 analogy to that would be that would be
00:17:52.960 the actual amplifier
00:17:54.960 and the thing hanging underneath would
00:17:57.120 kind of be a speaker if you're talking
00:17:58.960 on audio terms
00:18:05.840 not that i could find
00:18:07.440 did it seem like there was any place or
00:18:10.160 even a need for a life support
00:18:23.919 i have the slightest idea how they
00:18:25.440 navigate you know like i said i think if
00:18:27.360 that uh
00:18:29.679 whatever controls the configuration the
00:18:31.760 amplifiers the focusing which is
00:18:33.760 basically their their navigation is most
00:18:36.480 probably on the upper level of the craft
00:18:38.799 that i didn't get the look out of and as
00:18:41.200 far as a conversation between them my
00:18:43.919 your guess is as good as mine
00:18:46.240 was the local means of propulsion the
00:18:48.960 same as this
00:18:50.320 uh across great space differences
00:18:53.600 what was the local means the local means
00:18:55.840 of propulsion is essentially them
00:18:57.919 balancing on
00:18:59.760 an out-of-phase gravity wave
00:19:02.000 and
00:19:03.520 it's not as stable as you would think
00:19:06.640 when the craft took off
00:19:09.360 it wobbled to some degree it's uh
00:19:13.679 i mean a modern day
00:19:15.840 hawker harrier or something along those
00:19:17.440 lines a vertical takeoff craft is much
00:19:19.039 more stable than them in the omicron
00:19:21.520 configuration which is that that mode of
00:19:24.080 travel the delta configuration is where
00:19:25.840 they use the three amplifiers
00:19:27.840 and uh
00:19:30.080 that's those are the only two methods i
00:19:32.080 i know about removing the crowd can one
00:19:34.400 pilot as far as you know pilot this uh
00:19:36.480 craft or does it take three or do you
00:19:38.240 know anything about that i don't know
00:19:40.960 i wanted it back in the red yeah
00:19:46.799 was that stable does it give off the
00:19:49.120 radiation
00:19:50.240 no it's stable
00:19:53.440 yeah theoretically elements
00:19:56.559 should reach a stability around anywhere
00:19:58.799 from 113 to 116 somewhere in there and
00:20:01.440 apparently that's true and again they
00:20:03.200 should reach a stability
00:20:05.120 somewhere up around 220 some odd
00:20:08.720 but uh you know whether those elements
00:20:10.480 will ever be synthesized or found
00:20:12.080 naturally
00:20:14.400 yeah it's unusually heavy
00:20:18.840 yeah the monuments of mars and do you
00:20:21.520 think we have faces
00:20:23.360 also
00:20:25.039 do i think we have bases now uh the
00:20:27.120 monuments of mars are
00:20:30.400 interesting
00:20:32.320 that's about
00:20:33.520 the most i can say it's if they're
00:20:35.039 suspicious
00:20:36.559 and uh
00:20:38.159 you know i really don't know until
00:20:39.200 there's more information you know i've
00:20:40.559 seen pictures of them and things along
00:20:42.480 those lines but the most recent mars
00:20:44.799 probe is taking uh low altitude
00:20:46.880 photographs of those so i guess everyone
00:20:49.200 will know in about a year
00:20:58.320 indirectly yeah
00:21:02.640 what about your perception of
00:21:04.720 time and length
00:21:07.840 and height
00:21:09.200 is it the same aboard the crap that's
00:21:10.720 off of it
00:21:12.320 why do you want to board compared to it
00:21:17.600 well as long as you're on the craft
00:21:19.600 everything seems completely normal your
00:21:21.200 time flows at a normal rate and
00:21:24.400 if you're off the craft and you're
00:21:25.840 comparing the time of someone in the
00:21:27.600 crowd coming off the crap there'll be a
00:21:28.799 definite difference there anything where
00:21:30.080 gravity is involved
00:21:31.760 you know even the shuttle astronauts
00:21:33.919 they'll come back just because of the
00:21:35.039 difference in gravity when they come
00:21:36.320 back they're uh
00:21:38.159 you know there'll be a slight difference
00:21:39.760 in time
00:21:42.640 did you learn of any other well-known
00:21:45.200 civilian scientists who are involved in
00:21:47.440 this
00:21:50.000 uh
00:21:51.760 yes not not involved in this but
00:21:53.760 involved in the gravity work
00:21:55.520 and he's at los alamos and we've had a
00:21:58.400 little bit of contact
00:22:01.919 i'd rather not just because so far no
00:22:04.960 one's bothering him and i'm sure he
00:22:06.240 wants to keep
00:22:20.080 no no there's only one
00:22:21.840 one place where the seats faced and it
00:22:23.760 uh
00:22:24.559 you know there again i said that's
00:22:26.000 advanced technology but it's not that
00:22:28.080 advanced because you know we have
00:22:29.360 something along the lines of that liquid
00:22:30.720 crystal that we could
00:22:32.480 you know make transparent and also use
00:22:34.159 as uh you know a display of sorts so
00:22:36.960 that's uh but this was metallic and we
00:22:39.440 haven't anything along the lines of the
00:22:42.080 toughness of you know
00:22:43.919 metal that you could drill into that can
00:22:45.520 become transparent
00:22:54.159 about 30 seconds or so
00:22:58.400 we have two related questions
00:23:00.559 are you aware of any instances where the
00:23:02.480 inside of an alien craft is much larger
00:23:05.120 than its
00:23:06.159 outside no i've heard stories like that
00:23:08.320 though but
00:23:09.840 i haven't uh
00:23:11.760 if i just followed up
00:23:15.039 the strong force that you've identified
00:23:17.120 with gravity a i know i've missed in
00:23:19.840 recent theories actually in the 11th
00:23:22.240 dimensional universe
00:23:25.760 i'm not saying that
00:23:28.000 does it operate on any principle related
00:23:30.000 to that yeah my main problem with that
00:23:32.240 and stephen hawking for that matter is
00:23:34.159 that
00:23:35.039 once you start creating other dimensions
00:23:37.760 it's like an excuse i mean in particle
00:23:39.440 physics they do that too when they can't
00:23:41.200 figure out something they say well you
00:23:42.799 know we don't know gravity as well it's
00:23:44.240 caused by the uh the graviton yeah they
00:23:46.480 make up particles like that
00:23:48.480 and you can do that with dimensions too
00:23:50.480 where'd it go i want to do another
00:23:51.679 dimension yeah it's like an excuse the
00:23:53.520 bottom line is you know as everyone has
00:23:55.679 said every physicist has said the answer
00:23:57.360 to everything is always simple
00:23:59.360 and it's there's not an 11-dimensional
00:24:01.279 universe it does first of all there
00:24:02.880 doesn't need to be because all this
00:24:04.960 technology works
00:24:06.720 you know one
00:24:08.080 dimensional essentially a
00:24:09.120 four-dimensional universe and and uh you
00:24:11.200 know there's there's no need for it
00:24:28.520 [Applause]
00:24:36.000 across the lake
00:24:37.600 no i've never been over there
00:24:47.760 baba getting back to his question about
00:24:49.679 if there is any difference between being
00:24:51.360 on the inside of a craft
00:24:53.360 well it's under power versus being on
00:24:55.279 the outside of a craft of course you
00:24:56.240 wouldn't experience that because you
00:24:57.120 weren't you were never on the craft when
00:24:58.400 it was powered right under power
00:25:01.279 well by the fact that the
00:25:03.039 screen became transparent and other
00:25:04.880 things were operational i can assume
00:25:06.400 that it was
00:25:07.440 there was some power generated
00:25:10.000 okay
00:25:12.000 bob
00:25:12.799 how long were you a part of the s4
00:25:14.559 project and
00:25:15.760 how key
00:25:16.960 of a person were you on the science team
00:25:22.400 i was probably there only
00:25:25.200 six months four months something like
00:25:27.440 that it's hard to remember as far as a
00:25:29.200 key person i'm sure i was the last wrong
00:25:31.120 on the ladder
00:25:32.380 [Music]
00:25:34.880 though
00:25:36.640 because no one has really gotten
00:25:37.919 anywhere
00:25:38.960 you know they were looking to me for
00:25:40.640 fresh ideas which i really didn't have
00:25:42.240 any anything because i didn't know what
00:25:44.240 really was going on or where they had
00:25:45.600 been so
00:25:46.799 uh
00:25:48.159 it was a very disorganized group
00:25:51.200 and that's
00:25:53.440 that's really all i can relay i don't
00:25:55.200 know i don't know how else to describe
00:25:56.559 it it was frustrating in that regard
00:25:58.080 it's very frustrating 115 does it have
00:26:00.640 mission models
00:26:02.480 does it have a mission lines spectral i
00:26:05.200 mentioned it does every other element
00:26:06.640 does yeah that you know
00:26:09.279 that well i haven't seen you know any
00:26:11.919 spectrographic analysis on it or uh
00:26:15.200 well actually
00:26:17.120 they did do i don't know if i if i saw
00:26:19.360 it though i saw a neutron bombardment
00:26:21.120 test and density measurements and things
00:26:22.640 like that but i i'm sure they carried
00:26:24.559 out that
00:26:26.080 that test on it but i wouldn't be able
00:26:27.360 to identify the alliance no you're not
00:26:28.960 aware of the results
00:26:31.520 you know they probably showed them to me
00:26:32.960 but i can't for the life i may remember
00:26:35.039 after four years
00:26:40.240 uh
00:26:42.960 in possibly in heavier stars or in you
00:26:45.279 know planets that uh so you know
00:26:47.600 surround the larger star system and uh
00:26:49.919 in fact some people brought up that
00:26:56.480 some people brought up that you know
00:26:58.000 that's that's ridiculous because you
00:26:59.840 know all the elements that we know of
00:27:01.360 are found on earth and that's you know
00:27:03.200 that's not true i think it's a technium
00:27:05.600 or something along those lines is only
00:27:07.520 is not found on earth and it's on the
00:27:08.880 periodic charts
00:27:16.120 [Music]
00:27:25.760 and they mapped it out in the south of
00:27:27.840 france they looked back and looked and
00:27:29.760 it has to fall where the natural belt of
00:27:32.320 uranium is there and i was wondering if
00:27:35.200 you know you had anything that would
00:27:36.320 lead you from what you saw with that
00:27:38.080 propulsion system to think that aliens
00:27:40.159 may have come here at one time to do
00:27:42.399 that
00:27:44.159 i don't know i mean no matter what
00:27:46.000 uranium is certainly a valuable right
00:27:48.880 you know element uh
00:27:53.039 i don't know
00:27:54.159 did you get to see any aliens at all no
00:28:00.080 in fact when you talk about
00:28:26.480 you know what's strange about the billy
00:28:27.679 meyer photographs that the discs that
00:28:31.039 one of the ones he took a picture of
00:28:32.399 looks exactly like the one that i looked
00:28:34.159 on but
00:28:35.520 yeah i'm certainly not an expert in the
00:28:36.880 field but some of those look
00:28:38.080 unbelievably fake
00:28:40.159 and i can't
00:28:41.440 especially the thing with it flying
00:28:42.880 around the tree i mean boy it looks like
00:28:44.799 it's hanging from a string
00:28:47.039 you know but why would he do that if he
00:28:48.399 had some authentic pictures and uh
00:28:50.640 i don't know i i have mixed feelings
00:28:52.159 about that
00:28:54.559 how do you feel about our do you have an
00:28:56.399 opinion of this conflict that allegedly
00:28:58.720 happened between gray's and the delta
00:29:00.480 force and what was it 89 or whatever
00:29:03.039 the great thing about that i really
00:29:04.799 don't really have an opinion i just you
00:29:06.559 know repeat it
00:29:08.080 do you think it really took place
00:29:10.399 why i don't know
00:29:15.679 yeah apparently there's one but i was
00:29:17.039 involved in the project that dealt with
00:29:18.640 it
00:29:19.440 and what's your next video
00:29:22.240 well it's really not a next video
00:29:23.760 there's the video that i made is being
00:29:25.600 redone by another company
00:29:27.520 only because they liked it so much and
00:29:29.440 uh they're just redoing the uh
00:29:31.919 graphics and making a little more
00:29:33.360 technical and
00:29:34.559 you know i'm just serving as a technical
00:29:36.559 advisor on it but
00:29:39.440 for the most part it's 60 to 70 percent
00:29:41.600 of it's you know the identical thing
00:29:43.120 they just uh wanted to do it
00:29:45.679 because this particular group of guys uh
00:29:48.640 involved i think companies call
00:29:49.919 dreamquest involved in uh special
00:29:52.480 effects we're really into the ufo thing
00:29:54.480 and they wanted to do it with modern day
00:29:56.240 stuff instead of you know knit stockings
00:29:58.480 and things like that
00:30:07.200 well it's certainly possible you know i
00:30:09.200 don't i don't have any information on
00:30:10.720 that but just by the emp generated you
00:30:12.880 know by the systems on the craft that
00:30:14.640 makes perfect sense to me i'm going to
00:30:16.559 ask you what kind of type of weapon do
00:30:18.240 they have
00:30:19.679 it's some sort of directed energy weapon
00:30:21.360 and i think it's a
00:30:23.679 like a laser beam well no a
00:30:26.480 particle
00:30:28.000 probably a neutron
00:30:30.720 how many levels
00:30:37.679 there might be two but i know there's
00:30:39.919 one because obviously i was on one but
00:30:41.600 uh
00:30:43.279 i can't actually remember if anyone
00:30:45.600 if there's any direct mention from there
00:30:48.480 there being a lower level
00:30:50.480 but
00:30:51.279 i really wasn't allowed to roam freely
00:30:53.200 around the whole place so i don't know
00:30:56.000 i really don't know
00:30:59.360 could you tell us about your education a
00:31:01.519 couple of different things
00:31:05.200 that varies widely
00:31:06.200 [Laughter]
00:31:09.279 i as far as electronic technology my
00:31:11.760 degree there is from caltech and physics
00:31:14.080 is from mit
00:31:16.640 what did
00:31:18.640 did you go to pierce college yeah i did
00:31:20.880 okay
00:31:21.919 where did you hear that
00:31:23.360 a friend said something that you know
00:31:25.760 somebody i don't even know i i just
00:31:27.279 thought well something i want to ask
00:31:28.640 because
00:31:30.559 yeah i went to pierce and northridge and
00:31:32.480 then uh
00:31:34.880 you know i'm terrible at dates i don't
00:31:36.320 remember what date i was at probably
00:31:38.320 like in 76 or something i was at pierce
00:31:41.120 and then 70
00:31:45.200 seven or eight
00:31:47.360 i went to northridge just for short time
00:31:49.519 for some classes i was at caltech and
00:31:51.519 then
00:31:52.640 mit after that
00:31:56.080 yeah some critics have suggested that
00:31:58.159 there is not a department of naval
00:32:00.399 intelligence as shown on your w your irs
00:32:03.279 record i wonder if you could address
00:32:04.799 that
00:32:06.000 yeah i've heard people say that before
00:32:07.679 but the bottom line is if you uh and
00:32:10.240 i've let other people check into that
00:32:12.799 bob explorer is a guy that managed to
00:32:14.720 trace that down through the irs and
00:32:17.279 if you write the zip code number on the
00:32:19.360 bottom of it
00:32:20.720 or
00:32:21.480 nc-101 or something like that
00:32:24.320 or etsy something anyway it gets to it
00:32:28.000 gets to somewhere in the navy
00:32:30.000 you know as far as if there's a
00:32:31.039 department of there
00:32:32.399 i don't know but uh you know that's
00:32:34.159 that's the w-2 that i got sent so
00:32:37.200 well that same person was saying the zip
00:32:39.600 code that was on there was someone that
00:32:42.399 was
00:32:43.200 in reserve unused in washington
00:32:46.399 that was unused yeah
00:32:48.399 well now he had he had uh correspondence
00:32:51.279 with someone in the navy
00:32:53.200 through that address i'm not talking
00:32:54.640 about bob excellent talking about bill
00:32:56.559 moore
00:32:57.519 oh bill moore i don't
00:32:59.039 i don't know milmore
00:33:01.039 i know he's gonna dig in himself yeah
00:33:03.519 that was his point
00:33:04.799 i guess he disputes everything i said he
00:33:06.399 said well there's two different types on
00:33:07.760 here and this and i said well you know
00:33:10.720 i don't know
00:33:11.919 so uh you know that's basically what i
00:33:14.000 get sent and uh
00:33:15.760 you know i've seen enough information
00:33:17.679 where that zip code works
00:33:19.919 and uh that's all the information i have
00:33:21.840 and i haven't pursued it selling
00:33:23.840 but maybe clarify for them why you think
00:33:25.440 this is a legitimate document because of
00:33:26.960 the
00:33:27.679 certain elements that are correct well
00:33:30.480 because of the amount of money right no
00:33:32.080 one would know the amount of money
00:33:33.200 except me and that was correct um
00:33:38.000 that's all the information i've got
00:33:40.000 i have two questions uh
00:33:42.320 they're not related to each other but
00:33:43.919 one is are they silent or noiseless and
00:33:47.919 b who signed your paychecks
00:33:51.600 as far as are they silent or noiseless
00:33:54.240 um
00:33:55.840 there's a slight hiss before they take
00:33:57.600 off
00:33:58.720 and up to a certain altitude
00:34:00.960 and that sounds like
00:34:02.559 a high voltage hiss
00:34:04.320 of sorts uh that's all the sounds that
00:34:06.960 i've heard i've heard lots of reports
00:34:08.320 about you know weird flying saucer type
00:34:10.639 sounds but uh you know i've never
00:34:12.320 encountered that um
00:34:15.359 who signed my paycheck there was a
00:34:16.639 signature on it but i don't know you
00:34:18.560 know whose it was i never even you know
00:34:20.480 the time that i catch the paycheck
00:34:23.280 that never even concerned me tracing
00:34:25.440 anything now so there wasn't a company
00:34:27.199 name up in the corner like this
00:34:29.599 paychecks well when i worked for the
00:34:31.440 federal government years ago
00:34:33.440 all you know
00:34:34.560 is a green treasury check there would be
00:34:36.399 no other papers with it or anything from
00:34:38.399 the department of treasury
00:34:40.399 no this is the department of naval
00:34:41.760 intelligence on on a check yeah okay
00:34:46.560 thank you bob a craft like that comes
00:34:48.719 into our atmosphere would you expect a
00:34:50.719 loud report
00:34:52.000 that might be
00:34:53.040 well it's solely dependent on the
00:34:54.159 velocity that it enters
00:34:57.040 so
00:34:58.000 if uh you're dealing with something that
00:34:59.440 manipulates gravity and doesn't have to
00:35:00.880 slingshot into the earth uh you know you
00:35:02.960 could come in at a low speed not heat up
00:35:05.280 not
00:35:06.079 not really encountering philosophy
00:35:08.640 right well yeah if you're trying to
00:35:10.640 supersonic then you get a report
00:35:12.880 if you're not you don't you know it's
00:35:14.720 pretty straightforward
00:35:17.920 uh when you were at a sport to your
00:35:19.520 knowledge what was the approximate
00:35:21.040 percentage of civilian versus military
00:35:23.359 personnel and what kind of uh job
00:35:25.680 categories
00:35:27.359 the civilian personnel were
00:35:29.680 scientific in nature and the military
00:35:31.520 personnel were only
00:35:33.760 security as far as the percentage it was
00:35:36.880 a small percentage of scientific to
00:35:40.160 military personnel
00:35:44.160 there i'm sure there were offices all
00:35:45.520 over the place but
00:35:47.119 when i came into the facility i was
00:35:49.280 essentially escorted right to where i
00:35:50.800 work
00:35:51.839 and worked there
00:35:53.280 other than the few amount of times that
00:35:54.880 i got to walk into the hangar and under
00:35:57.440 an escort too and when i left it was the
00:35:58.960 same so like i said there might be
00:36:00.720 offices there might be
00:36:02.320 bunkers in there there might be
00:36:03.920 underground levels there might be an
00:36:05.359 alien nest in there i haven't you know
00:36:10.960 excuse me how did you eat how did you
00:36:12.960 eat
00:36:13.760 the only place i ever ate was at area
00:36:15.599 51. so if there was a cafeteria there i
00:36:17.680 never got to eat him
00:36:22.800 i usually came with dennis mariana he
00:36:24.720 was my supervisor now i wasn't on
00:36:27.119 a full-time
00:36:28.960 swing essentially i
00:36:30.800 flew in usually between three and
00:36:33.280 or between four and five o'clock at
00:36:34.880 night and left by eleven
00:36:37.040 so i was only there for a short time
00:36:38.800 each day
00:36:41.440 rob aboard the bus from groom lake to
00:36:43.200 papoose how many people were on that
00:36:45.280 reporting with you
00:36:46.960 very few
00:36:48.000 more than one more than yourself
00:36:49.839 that's me and dennis and usually
00:36:52.880 like well actually not usually
00:36:54.079 occasionally one other person how about
00:36:55.520 barry
00:36:57.119 i don't think i were so barry on the
00:36:58.320 west
00:36:59.440 just two of you
00:37:02.240 is there a chance that any of the
00:37:03.200 workers might defect
00:37:05.040 yeah
00:37:06.160 barry would that's why i spent some time
00:37:08.000 trying to get a hold of him and there
00:37:09.440 was actually some time after all this
00:37:11.119 hit the news and the whole thing went
00:37:12.640 down we got a call from dennis my
00:37:14.400 supervisor
00:37:15.760 and he arranged a meeting at the union
00:37:17.520 plaza hotel
00:37:19.280 and when we got there i brought three
00:37:21.599 people with me and
00:37:24.800 i think he said he'd be in the casino
00:37:26.400 area somewhere and we went back gene
00:37:28.640 huff came with me and
00:37:30.170 [Music]
00:37:31.680 we went into the area
00:37:33.839 and walking down the corridor i
00:37:35.520 recognized one of the security personnel
00:37:38.000 from there and then when i finally found
00:37:39.760 dennis he didn't even acknowledge my
00:37:41.839 presence
00:37:43.920 couldn't get his attention and
00:37:46.160 you know i left so apparently someone
00:37:48.320 had
00:37:49.760 known of the conversation and sent
00:37:51.599 someone down there and made themselves
00:37:53.359 obvious to dennis or something happened
00:37:55.520 and we left but i think that was uh
00:37:58.240 where dennis really wanted to say
00:37:59.599 something
00:38:02.560 i understand that you used hypnotic
00:38:04.240 progression to get at some of the
00:38:05.359 details of your experience if so what is
00:38:07.920 your impression of hypnotic aggression
00:38:09.440 as a tool
00:38:11.760 it's probably reasonable because there
00:38:14.240 are specifics
00:38:16.960 they contend that you can sit there and
00:38:19.119 re-read a document as if you had
00:38:21.920 as if you were there reading it for the
00:38:23.119 first time and uh what i was mainly
00:38:25.280 interested was in some of the schematics
00:38:26.880 and drawings
00:38:28.160 and uh
00:38:29.920 you know i
00:38:30.960 did some of the hypnosis stuff with lane
00:38:32.640 keck
00:38:33.680 had no therapist in town
00:38:35.599 and i was certainly able to redraw
00:38:39.440 a lot of the
00:38:40.640 schematics and you know engineering
00:38:42.160 drawings along those lines and it's uh
00:38:46.000 so
00:38:46.720 as far as using is that a tool for that
00:38:48.640 that seems to work
00:38:50.720 for anything else
00:38:53.680 i have two two things one's a common the
00:38:56.640 other one's a question
00:38:58.079 uh first of all um when i was 12 years
00:39:00.560 old i i saw a daylight flying disc
00:39:03.599 which
00:39:04.400 looked exactly like one of billy meyer's
00:39:06.960 photographs 15 years later
00:39:10.400 and uh
00:39:11.520 and this just earlier no
00:39:14.880 earlier 15 years earlier i saw this disc
00:39:17.440 and then
00:39:18.560 billy meyer took a photo in 1975 with
00:39:21.599 the same
00:39:22.640 exactly the same disc that i saw so
00:39:26.000 down to the last detail it's the same
00:39:28.240 and then you said that
00:39:30.160 the sport model looked a lot like the
00:39:32.320 same photo in a
00:39:35.920 interview with georgetown and
00:39:39.040 i thought that was really interesting
00:39:40.400 because it kind of tied it all together
00:39:41.839 for me
00:39:43.280 and then uh just i just wanted to make
00:39:45.359 that comment and then the question i had
00:39:47.839 was uh what was the year of your
00:39:49.520 graduation from mit and did you have a
00:39:52.240 phd no it's a master's degree
00:39:59.680 the year what was the year graduation
00:40:01.520 probably
00:40:04.400 probably 82 because i think i left there
00:40:07.359 went to los alamos i went to los alamos
00:40:12.400 is there can you talk about the mind
00:40:14.240 control that some people said was used
00:40:16.319 on you
00:40:17.200 when you decided to leave muscle with
00:40:18.560 friends
00:40:20.000 what mind control didn't happen
00:40:22.000 someone made the comment
00:40:29.760 when i was first brought there they had
00:40:31.680 a doctor or a nurse actually in uh
00:40:35.119 political medical setup there and
00:40:38.560 right after i had signed all the release
00:40:40.160 papers and my first time out there i
00:40:42.079 went in and they did what i perceived to
00:40:44.880 be an allergen test because i put a grid
00:40:47.040 on my arm and different
00:40:49.760 you know particularly different
00:40:51.040 chemicals and
00:40:52.800 you know it was their
00:40:54.079 convention that well there's a lot of
00:40:55.520 strange elements here and unusual things
00:40:57.920 you'll be working on so they're trying
00:40:59.359 to see if you're gonna have any adverse
00:41:00.560 reaction to them
00:41:01.920 and uh i was given something to drink i
00:41:04.720 i said it smelled like pine
00:41:06.960 uh which it did you know that's the best
00:41:10.000 way i can describe it and a lot of
00:41:12.319 people jumped on that saying aha well
00:41:14.079 that's the mind control substance when
00:41:15.520 you leave work you're gonna forget
00:41:16.560 everything when you come back you can
00:41:17.599 remember everything but you know i think
00:41:19.200 if anything it was an anti-allergen drug
00:41:21.200 or something along those lines how about
00:41:22.960 the threats
00:41:24.560 being used
00:41:26.400 yeah
00:41:27.599 threats how many can you feel
00:41:29.359 like bodily harm or
00:41:31.119 loss of pension or what kind of stuff
00:41:35.440 you know jail time that was part of
00:41:36.800 signing the paperwork as far as bodily
00:41:38.560 harm after they caught
00:41:41.680 us the time i brought out john lear and
00:41:43.119 a couple other people up there then they
00:41:44.720 threatened me and uh they really didn't
00:41:47.040 get much reaction out of that then they
00:41:48.560 threatened my wife at the time and uh
00:41:51.280 you know that uh
00:41:53.760 they really threw out everything they
00:41:55.119 could
00:41:56.000 without physically you know attacking
00:41:58.400 well that's what i was wondering once i
00:41:59.920 knew it was bill you not dennis or
00:42:02.800 someone else or anything why didn't they
00:42:04.720 just arrest you under charges of you
00:42:06.640 know violating the app well they can't
00:42:08.560 arrest me because they have to admit you
00:42:10.960 know that this is classified material
00:42:13.520 yeah they have to release it you know
00:42:14.880 why did they you know kill me
00:42:17.440 uh
00:42:19.119 you know that i really don't know so
00:42:20.480 maybe that had to do with uh how i got
00:42:22.880 the job or
00:42:24.640 you know
00:42:25.440 referencing the
00:42:26.640 connection to that teller or something
00:42:28.079 along those lines but
00:42:30.960 i don't know were there any contractor
00:42:33.200 names departments divisions that were
00:42:35.920 mentioned or signs on the wall or
00:42:37.599 anything like that referring to any
00:42:38.880 companies or anything like that no but i
00:42:41.359 know eg had nothing to do with it that's
00:42:44.640 the only light i can on that
00:42:46.079 because uh i had mentioned that to him
00:42:48.880 once because that's where i was
00:42:49.839 interviewed at the eg building and
00:42:52.640 i thought that it was part of an egmg
00:42:54.560 project and i think it was dennis
00:42:56.960 who said that you know we don't let
00:42:59.119 those people you know anywhere near this
00:43:01.119 place or any you know they were just
00:43:04.240 a sore thumb to them
00:43:06.960 well as a as one way of getting this
00:43:09.359 information out and at the same time the
00:43:11.119 government stopped harassing you did you
00:43:12.480 ever consider bringing them to court
00:43:16.960 threatening your family harassing you
00:43:18.960 and
00:43:19.599 as a result of that forcing them to what
00:43:22.240 evidence would i do that i mean it's
00:43:23.520 hard enough to prove it to uh you know
00:43:25.920 the layman in general but taking it to
00:43:27.599 court
00:43:28.880 it's impossible and there's uh
00:43:31.599 so yeah there's plenty of people that
00:43:32.640 don't believe me anyway so you never
00:43:34.160 stood on legal counsel with regard to
00:43:35.599 any of this well a little yeah initially
00:43:38.720 and uh you know the bottom line is you
00:43:41.200 know the attorney said there is
00:43:42.240 absolutely nothing to go on it's a total
00:43:43.680 waste of time and you know if anything
00:43:45.520 it's going to be a public forum
00:43:47.359 uh to discredit me in some manner so uh
00:43:50.400 you know i even go through with it what
00:43:52.319 about class action aclu
00:43:55.599 but still you need you know some sort of
00:43:57.839 evidence that uh this happened if i
00:43:59.920 pulled out a piece of 115 and said here
00:44:02.000 well what does that have to do with
00:44:03.040 anything you know and uh
00:44:04.720 there's nothing that uh
00:44:07.200 and what did they do to violate my
00:44:09.200 rights that i didn't agree to at the
00:44:10.640 beginning so they really had their bases
00:44:12.560 covered it's pretty dirty what they did
00:44:14.000 to you in las vegas there in 1990 in the
00:44:16.160 summer
00:44:17.359 that was pretty good
00:44:18.960 what was that
00:44:21.200 well yeah that was that was my own call
00:44:25.200 so you've been through your counseling
00:44:27.520 by saying that right
00:44:30.160 how would um someone get a piece of
00:44:32.720 paper explaining the physical properties
00:44:34.720 used in these in this mode of
00:44:36.720 transportation
00:44:38.640 the physical properties i mean i mean
00:44:40.640 the
00:44:41.440 formula is used in the gravity if you're
00:44:44.000 being watched currently if you have any
00:44:46.720 interaction
00:44:48.000 it's strange you should mention that uh
00:44:50.640 there's been nothing uh for
00:44:54.000 probably these four years or three years
00:44:55.760 whatever it's been but uh
00:44:58.640 the other day
00:45:00.480 one of my phone lines has not been
00:45:02.079 working and the other one was breaking
00:45:03.680 up so i called centel down and
00:45:06.400 they checked the house out and said
00:45:07.599 there's nothing in the wiring here and
00:45:08.800 they called me down from charleston
00:45:10.160 boulevard from the from the telephone
00:45:12.400 phone they said
00:45:13.760 my individual line was cut and that the
00:45:16.560 other one
00:45:17.599 those other wires were stripped and
00:45:18.800 twist tied together so of course me
00:45:21.200 being paranoid things well someone
00:45:22.800 tapped in there but i really can't think
00:45:24.160 of another excuse of me being uh
00:45:26.560 you know just my single lines being
00:45:28.480 played with but uh that's what he said
00:45:30.640 and you know they filed a report on that
00:45:32.319 so that's
00:45:33.599 one form of documentation
00:45:35.599 you say your records at cal tech and mit
00:45:38.640 have somehow disappeared
00:45:40.480 in los alamos and apparently everyone
00:45:42.480 else is there any way you can you could
00:45:44.280 reconstruct your coursework and your
00:45:47.119 professors oh sure i've got people that
00:45:49.200 uh
00:45:50.319 you know that i went to school with and
00:45:51.839 george's spoke george knapp has spoken
00:45:53.359 to some of them and you know even flew
00:45:54.880 with me up to los alamos and spoke to my
00:45:56.640 colleagues there and uh you know it's
00:45:58.400 just could you could you reveal some of
00:46:00.800 your professors at mit and caltech
00:46:04.079 yeah if you want
00:46:05.839 i don't have a list of them here dr
00:46:08.000 duxler i think was one of them and uh
00:46:12.720 postfield was another
00:46:15.200 post field
00:46:16.640 h-o-h-s-f
00:46:18.319 i-e-l-d or something along those lines
00:46:20.560 they remember you oh yeah i was feeling
00:46:22.800 well these were mit or
00:46:25.760 uh hostfield was at uh mit
00:46:29.920 that duxler was at caltech
00:46:35.359 yeah
00:46:36.160 who's barry
00:46:37.760 barry's a guy i worked with they
00:46:40.400 essentially worked on the buddy system
00:46:41.839 there and uh
00:46:44.560 someone you have ideas to bounce bounce
00:46:46.640 off of and uh bury a castilio or castile
00:46:50.160 will be there before you or yeah a long
00:46:52.400 time
00:46:54.079 it's probably still there did you get
00:46:56.640 any information from him
00:46:58.800 well he essentially taught me
00:47:00.720 everything that they had done up to date
00:47:03.599 in the course of your work
00:47:05.359 uh
00:47:06.240 did they ever mention any other
00:47:07.599 facilities installation around the
00:47:11.200 no they did mention though that uh this
00:47:13.680 was the place that all of this stuff was
00:47:15.920 brought to and it was really
00:47:18.000 purposely condensed here to keep an eye
00:47:19.760 on everything and have uh you know
00:47:21.359 immediate access to everything that
00:47:23.040 dealt with this you know the alien
00:47:24.640 technology
00:47:27.200 regarding the crap of the alien craft um
00:47:30.240 were there any test personnel that
00:47:32.559 crashed them and if so do you know about
00:47:35.359 what the causes were i didn't read about
00:47:37.760 any
00:47:38.480 crashes during tests at all
00:47:41.440 but you'd think that there would be some
00:47:43.280 but
00:47:44.240 i didn't
00:47:46.319 when you were at caltech were you
00:47:47.680 affiliated with any of the student
00:47:49.359 houses
00:47:50.559 no
00:47:54.880 um when i first heard of uh s4 it
00:47:57.839 reminded me a lot of disc testing that
00:48:00.160 i've heard of that goes on in australia
00:48:02.960 at pine gap and i was wondering if you
00:48:05.200 know anything about pine gap did you
00:48:06.880 read anything about find out that you
00:48:08.880 could tell us about i really don't keep
00:48:10.800 abreast of the
00:48:12.240 ufo information as far as officially i
00:48:14.319 never read anything i've heard the name
00:48:15.599 pine gap mentioned but um
00:48:18.480 i haven't heard anything about that
00:48:21.280 has anybody ever approached you with a
00:48:22.720 screenplay offer oh god yeah
00:48:26.960 constantly
00:48:28.240 do you ever consider that
00:48:30.000 uh yeah
00:48:31.359 the main problem columbia pictures last
00:48:33.280 year really wanted to do it and uh
00:48:36.079 they said we're making a screenplay and
00:48:38.160 and my only problem is is that uh if you
00:48:41.040 guys are going to make a movie it has to
00:48:42.400 be exactly what happened and not the
00:48:43.839 hollywood version i don't want to see
00:48:45.200 stephen sigal in the rain
00:48:49.930 [Applause]
00:48:58.400 do you have any speculation
00:49:00.319 why they recruited someone with a master
00:49:02.400 specifically phd no that's that's a
00:49:05.280 really good question
00:49:06.960 i've always said there's
00:49:08.400 plenty more people qualified than i am
00:49:10.480 and uh
00:49:11.599 if there's any there's only two reasons
00:49:13.599 they could have is either number one uh
00:49:16.880 was that dr teller essentially juiced me
00:49:19.440 into the position that said you know
00:49:21.040 there's a guy bubbles i know i'm finding
00:49:22.640 a blaze for him or
00:49:24.720 that the fact that i have traditionally
00:49:26.960 approached everything from a very
00:49:28.559 strange angle and uh you know
00:49:31.119 essentially off the beaten path and you
00:49:32.880 know tackling you know technical
00:49:34.319 problems so it's only one of those two
00:49:36.240 reasons and unless there's a third one
00:49:37.920 that i
00:49:38.800 have no idea about
00:49:40.160 two things do you think they'll ever
00:49:41.280 release this information and if they
00:49:42.960 don't how do you think it'll ever come
00:49:44.640 out besides people like you know or will
00:49:47.599 be something like what you're doing
00:49:50.079 well hopefully it's not this way
00:49:51.280 hopefully there's going to be a
00:49:52.800 release of information eventually but
00:49:56.559 you know whether or not they're going to
00:49:57.680 say uh
00:49:59.440 you know okay we've been keeping the
00:50:00.720 secret for so long it uh almost seems to
00:50:03.359 me that they need a staged incident uh
00:50:05.440 to get them off the hook
00:50:07.040 take a flying saucer up in a c-130 and
00:50:09.119 push it out the back and say look
00:50:11.430 [Laughter]
00:50:17.910 [Music]
00:50:20.319 they don't apply once you've distorted
00:50:22.640 distorting gravity essentially having a
00:50:24.559 gravity amplifier distorts time and
00:50:26.240 space and that those really don't apply
00:50:28.480 there's no interaction
00:50:30.559 so there would be no effect on humans
00:50:32.319 either no there's no effect inside at
00:50:34.319 all
00:50:37.040 bob did you when you were working on the
00:50:38.960 escort project did your education and
00:50:41.680 whatever scientific vision that you have
00:50:44.400 permit you to believe that at some point
00:50:46.720 you'd be able to make a meaningful
00:50:47.920 contribution to the program and if so
00:50:50.160 after how much time
00:50:52.559 uh i was always in serious doubt whether
00:50:54.800 or not they were going to get rid of me
00:50:56.000 because uh i had
00:50:59.119 there really really wasn't anything that
00:51:00.640 i could contribute i wasn't an expert in
00:51:03.040 any particular field uh that they were
00:51:05.359 dealing with
00:51:06.559 so
00:51:08.160 uh i mean i made some contributions as
00:51:10.079 far as uh
00:51:11.680 determining what element they were
00:51:12.880 dealing with was but uh that was
00:51:14.720 significant right
00:51:16.960 yeah
00:51:18.640 to some degree
00:51:34.480 your education pretty traditionally
00:51:36.160 grounded as far as your own views as far
00:51:38.319 as physics as well
00:51:40.240 as common knowledge
00:51:42.960 and in other words how surprised were
00:51:45.119 you when they started showing you all
00:51:46.559 this hardware and these concepts that
00:51:48.720 could do things that
00:51:50.880 is really
00:51:52.000 oh very i was
00:51:57.359 even when i was reading the
00:51:58.400 documentation you know the alien
00:52:02.160 the alien question really never entered
00:52:03.920 my mind i kept pushing it off to
00:52:06.160 you know all this group of scientists
00:52:07.599 secretly came up with now i never and i
00:52:10.960 i just had a mental block against that
00:52:12.559 because i always thought flying saucers
00:52:14.000 were totally ridiculous and the people
00:52:15.760 that uh
00:52:17.280 really paid attention to such phenomena
00:52:19.040 we're
00:52:20.000 we're just out in left field you know
00:52:21.280 they belong thanks bob
00:52:24.720 but it really made very little sense to
00:52:26.640 me that that
00:52:29.040 you know anyone would deal with
00:52:30.319 something like that
00:52:31.599 so i really held out to the very end and
00:52:34.400 you know they finally said well bob
00:52:37.359 that was it
00:52:40.559 did you ever hear any
00:52:43.040 air force or military squadron
00:52:51.440 yeah i probably did
00:52:53.280 but i can't
00:52:54.559 remember
00:52:55.680 i do remember someone talking about
00:52:57.280 something along those lines
00:53:00.400 uh i i don't think they were pilots but
00:53:02.480 there was someone
00:53:04.960 someone related to the air force i don't
00:53:06.720 remember
00:53:07.760 who or they were talking about the air
00:53:09.040 force and i think they mentioned
00:53:11.280 a squadron and i don't know if that was
00:53:13.200 what they called
00:53:14.480 the group that flew the craft or with
00:53:16.640 someone else you know at groom lake
00:53:20.319 i really don't know
00:53:24.960 no it really wasn't much you know idle
00:53:27.359 banter going on
00:53:30.800 as far as like the gravitational field
00:53:32.319 with these crafts and so forth if you
00:53:33.680 were to amplify it enough
00:53:35.440 could you um
00:53:37.520 enlarge the area that you wanted to take
00:53:39.280 in other words could you
00:53:40.720 move more than just the craft itself say
00:53:42.640 two craft under the same
00:53:44.480 power source and so forth
00:53:47.599 or even you know even ever consider
00:53:49.920 something like that as
00:53:52.160 feasible
00:53:53.920 well like a tractor base
00:53:56.319 it's possible as long as they were both
00:53:58.559 uh
00:54:00.800 essentially in the field that was being
00:54:02.400 emitted
00:54:03.599 um i don't i really don't know what uh
00:54:07.440 you know how the level of energy relates
00:54:09.440 to the amount of mass
00:54:11.200 that can be bent that way or how the
00:54:13.200 amount of space they can
00:54:15.680 those numbers i really don't have so
00:54:18.720 it's just again do you think it'd be
00:54:20.160 feasible
00:54:28.480 i really don't know that uh
00:54:30.640 anything that i assume was control
00:54:32.319 systems or instrumentation was up up
00:54:34.640 above and i think that's where the
00:54:36.000 navigation computation took place and
00:54:38.799 uh you know i dealt with only the strict
00:54:41.119 the power hungry components essentially
00:54:45.280 when you were
00:54:46.400 at s4 was there ever either a period
00:54:49.280 within a day or even a couple of days
00:54:52.000 where you
00:54:53.280 at this point don't remember what you
00:54:55.280 were doing during that time
00:54:57.200 was there ever a period of time that
00:54:58.799 you're not able to encounter
00:55:00.640 yeah i kind of i said that and again
00:55:02.400 that's been taken
00:55:04.079 and bent a lot of different ways too
00:55:05.839 there were times that it that i left and
00:55:07.760 it's because so much stuff i was exposed
00:55:09.920 to
00:55:11.599 i was essentially drowning information
00:55:13.599 and when i got back home i couldn't i
00:55:15.599 really couldn't remember what day
00:55:16.880 anything happened uh you know that did i
00:55:19.920 forget big chunks of knowledge no i just
00:55:22.319 uh you know they're like periods of days
00:55:24.720 where you're not you haven't recalled
00:55:26.000 what happened during those days
00:55:29.359 and
00:55:30.400 second you probably don't want to get
00:55:31.440 into this but i really appreciate if you
00:55:32.799 would when you were walking either by
00:55:34.799 the hallway or down
00:55:36.559 there by the door with the window in it
00:55:39.200 and you look through will you go into
00:55:40.880 that and describe what you did i mean
00:55:43.520 even if you're not sure say
00:55:45.520 just made it as exactly as
00:55:47.440 well this has to be taken in the right
00:55:48.960 context too first of all being
00:55:50.640 surrounded by the
00:55:52.480 you know flying saucers knowing that the
00:55:54.319 alien thing exists and all this
00:55:55.920 technology uh when i was walking down a
00:55:58.640 hall to the uh
00:56:00.160 i don't remember where i was going
00:56:01.280 anymore but uh
00:56:03.280 different doors to the hangers are small
00:56:05.599 nine inch square windows with wire mesh
00:56:07.920 running through them and i i looked at
00:56:09.680 one as i i walked by and was still told
00:56:12.079 to keep my head forward and
00:56:14.720 i saw the backs of two guys and they
00:56:16.400 were talking to a child or i thought it
00:56:18.720 was a small child and you know of course
00:56:21.440 when i told that to john leary he said
00:56:23.280 that was an alien
00:56:25.359 and
00:56:26.160 i don't know what it was i don't know if
00:56:27.680 it was a small guy but it just looked
00:56:29.680 weird it was a glance so you know do i
00:56:31.680 think it was an alien though did you see
00:56:33.359 this the quote small guy
00:56:36.799 did you see the small guy or you only
00:56:38.240 saw the two guys looking downward
00:56:40.480 no i saw the small guy
00:56:42.480 saw the small guy that they were talking
00:56:44.000 to yeah what did it
00:56:46.160 well i it was just it was just a glance
00:56:48.240 i have no idea that's why i said i
00:56:50.079 believe if i had a rounded head and big
00:56:52.000 eyes i'd say hey there's an alien there
00:56:53.839 but you know i can't say that
00:56:55.760 but it wasn't small
00:57:10.400 also look at it from a technical
00:57:11.920 viewpoint that it could be a model a
00:57:14.079 life-size model they're trying to see
00:57:15.599 how how the size relationship works in
00:57:17.920 the seats and other parts of the craft
00:57:19.440 and you know what's accessible so it
00:57:20.720 doesn't necessarily mean that it was a
00:57:22.640 living game
00:57:25.359 would you mind speaking at all about
00:57:27.599 how this body of knowledge has affected
00:57:29.760 you emotionally or
00:57:31.760 maybe spiritually are you frightened by
00:57:34.079 the implications of what all this means
00:57:37.040 or no
00:57:38.839 um you've no doubt thought about the
00:57:41.760 the overall agenda
00:57:44.240 i'm speculating i'm sure you know yeah
00:57:46.400 but it's difficult to really uh
00:57:49.760 you know put a finger on it
00:57:51.760 since there's so little evidence to go
00:57:53.599 and really 99 of the stuff that i hear
00:57:58.880 you know i really don't even come close
00:58:01.040 to believing at all and it's not just
00:58:02.480 because i'm skeptical it's because it's
00:58:03.920 absolutely ridiculous
00:58:05.839 uh you know i even though it's stepping
00:58:08.160 on a lot of people's toes you know i i
00:58:10.319 think 99 percent of the sightings out
00:58:12.559 here
00:58:13.680 are absolutely not flying saucers most
00:58:16.319 people are watching 737s coming to uh
00:58:18.880 groom lake and they may turn up there
00:58:20.319 and there's lights on the planes and uh
00:58:22.880 that i mean along the same lines there's
00:58:25.520 uh
00:58:27.280 these parachuted flares that they fire
00:58:29.119 off near the papoose lake area and
00:58:31.040 they're an orange color which is pretty
00:58:32.640 coincidental and they're on essentially
00:58:34.559 a modified small hot air balloon so the
00:58:36.319 burning
00:58:37.200 heat of the flare keeps it afloat longer
00:58:39.520 and uh whether they're doing that for
00:58:41.280 disinformation or practicing
00:58:43.520 how missiles lock on to you know heat
00:58:45.280 seeking targets again i don't know but i
00:58:46.960 think
00:58:47.680 99 of that stuff is what you know people
00:58:51.040 you know they come around this area
00:58:53.520 it seems as if even knowing that we
00:58:55.760 possess alien technology hasn't even
00:58:57.760 made you a believer
00:59:00.799 that's probably true
00:59:02.720 but it has i mean i believe the stuff
00:59:04.319 that i worked on there's absolutely no
00:59:05.680 question in my mind
00:59:07.280 but uh
00:59:09.440 i think everyone can only go so far and
00:59:11.599 i can't
00:59:12.880 i just hate to speculate because i hate
00:59:14.799 to be wrong i don't want to say well you
00:59:16.799 know this they had to be given to us
00:59:18.720 because they're you know we didn't shoot
00:59:20.000 them down and you know it's uh so i i
00:59:22.319 just stopped right there i think we
00:59:23.680 forget sometimes you're a scientist
00:59:25.760 maybe so i i just i stopped with what
00:59:28.000 i'm i'm pretty sure with him
00:59:30.319 what is your synopsis in a nutshell
00:59:34.960 based upon your what you saw and what
00:59:36.640 you experienced well i can't like i said
00:59:38.160 i stopped before that you know i have
00:59:39.760 lots of possible ideas in my mind based
00:59:42.400 only on what your experience was only on
00:59:44.559 what you saw what is your synopsis my
00:59:46.559 synopsis of what i know to be true
00:59:49.040 that the government is holding
00:59:51.440 uh nine alien spacecraft
00:59:56.000 that are propelled by
00:59:58.960 a modified gravity generator
01:00:01.280 uh
01:00:03.520 it's being the work is being conducted
01:00:05.359 15 miles south of green lake
01:00:08.000 at that isolated area only designated as
01:00:10.559 s4
01:00:11.920 that at least one of those crafts
01:00:13.440 operate
01:00:14.880 and
01:00:16.400 that's about it okay thanks
01:00:19.200 bob did you ever see the smell
01:00:24.400 no
01:00:25.119 not at all
01:00:26.400 did you ever see the word s4 written
01:00:27.839 anywhere
01:00:28.880 for the letters asked for it
01:00:33.760 that's a good question
01:00:37.119 what was the question the question is
01:00:38.799 did he ever see
01:00:40.160 s4 written anywhere
01:00:43.839 on your badge
01:00:46.400 yeah the s-word was punched out on the
01:00:48.480 badge down so you never saw it
01:00:50.240 was more along my eyes i was thinking it
01:00:51.599 was a sign and i think
01:00:55.119 because it's hard to see i think near
01:00:57.119 when you approach the papoose mountain
01:00:58.720 range
01:00:59.599 that there is a sign that designates it
01:01:01.440 as s4 but if i
01:01:04.000 i'm pretty sure i saw a sign there
01:01:05.599 because i can only see out the front
01:01:06.720 window when i'm when i'm going through
01:01:08.079 there and i'm not
01:01:09.440 i'm really not sure what it's what it
01:01:11.040 said but since most other science
01:01:13.040 designated it's an area or tech area or
01:01:15.440 something along those lines that might
01:01:17.040 have been s4 if that's because that's
01:01:18.720 what you're experiencing so you just
01:01:19.760 heard it orally s4 orally and that's how
01:01:21.920 you
01:01:22.880 know the designated panel well yeah and
01:01:24.640 then as someone else mentioned on the
01:01:25.920 badge that was scar punched out there
01:01:28.000 but as far as an actual sign to the area
01:01:30.880 uh
01:01:31.920 i didn't see it in any other writing so
01:01:33.839 did you ever see it on the vagina since
01:01:34.880 it was punched out you wouldn't see it
01:01:37.119 well that's it it really says it
01:01:39.200 directly above it i mean the star punch
01:01:41.440 oh so how was it written s four dash oh
01:01:44.720 dash there's a hyphen in there yeah oh
01:01:49.359 cause bill moore's making a big thing i
01:01:50.880 said how is it how do you write it he's
01:01:52.400 talking to george knapp trying to debunk
01:01:53.920 the whole thing how do you write s4 you
01:01:55.520 know
01:01:58.240 does it make a difference right right
01:02:00.799 that's what you call pick and use yeah
01:02:03.440 well i know there's a lot of people that
01:02:04.799 don't believe the story you know all
01:02:06.319 together but uh you know i
01:02:08.799 it's uh
01:02:10.880 it's difficult that it you know there's
01:02:12.960 really a limit to what you know what
01:02:14.240 else could i possibly do
01:02:16.400 uh you know to show people what happened
01:02:18.559 other than
01:02:20.400 you know relaying some of the
01:02:21.359 information and things along those lines
01:02:24.480 um what kind of work are you doing now
01:02:27.359 a variety of things i mean everything
01:02:29.520 from uh i have
01:02:31.200 three separate companies one is uh deals
01:02:34.480 with uh commercial photo processing the
01:02:36.799 other one is uh
01:02:38.319 developing uh and repairing alpha
01:02:40.480 radiation detectors for radiation off of
01:02:42.960 uh
01:02:44.079 plutonium which unfortunately that's
01:02:45.920 going down the tubes because they
01:02:46.960 stopped the testing out here
01:02:48.640 and
01:02:49.680 i do computer graphics a lot of that and
01:02:54.240 actually music videos believe it or not
01:02:57.440 are you still building and racing jet
01:02:58.880 cars
01:03:00.160 well i don't i don't do it for money
01:03:02.640 anymore and i just take the jet car out
01:03:04.480 and run it around but uh it's i kind of
01:03:07.200 got scared when most i when i originally
01:03:09.599 started racing jet cars were
01:03:13.119 like
01:03:14.000 25 people or something along those lines
01:03:16.079 that were licensed to drive
01:03:17.839 uh and uh
01:03:19.760 now there's like seven and the guy when
01:03:22.160 i stopped racing the guy that framed me
01:03:23.920 crashed so you know everyone else is
01:03:25.760 dead so
01:03:26.720 i don't race anymore you still have the
01:03:28.839 lamborghini the body sitting in the
01:03:30.960 backyard the car i take out once in
01:03:32.640 every couple weeks of the dry lake
01:03:34.799 laying around
01:03:35.920 two questions do you have any idea how
01:03:38.240 they achieve that proton source of
01:03:40.880 steady stream of such a small reactor
01:03:44.160 it could be a radioactive element i mean
01:03:46.319 you could use
01:03:48.960 well proton source could certainly be
01:03:52.880 they could be using alpha particles for
01:03:54.640 that matter which is essentially a
01:03:55.920 helium nuclei
01:03:58.240 and there's lots of elements that can do
01:04:00.160 that
01:04:01.440 the other part is
01:04:03.039 in the video we saw
01:04:05.920 the badge have the
01:04:08.079 letters and capital letters maj written
01:04:11.520 turnovers was that actually on your
01:04:13.280 badge yeah that was really on there and
01:04:15.359 uh
01:04:16.319 i was told majestic was the level of
01:04:18.160 clearance that that was cleared for
01:04:20.559 that also that makes you know you wonder
01:04:22.720 about you know
01:04:24.319 uh bill moore's thing at the mj 12
01:04:27.520 documents and all that
01:04:29.119 is that you know actual or uh
01:04:32.720 considering that uh these guys had made
01:04:35.200 posters that they're here and things
01:04:36.880 like that they could have
01:04:38.799 taken majestic and made it the name of
01:04:41.200 it just as kind of a tongue-in-cheek
01:04:42.720 thing uh you know or was that
01:04:45.440 actual evidence that uh you know
01:04:47.200 majestic 12 actually just existed and
01:04:49.200 all that so what about your other
01:04:50.880 associates did their badge look
01:04:52.799 identical to the one we saw
01:04:54.720 pretty much so except dennis's looked
01:04:56.079 different and for the most part they had
01:04:57.599 different areas punched in them
01:05:02.640 at one time you said that you thought
01:05:04.559 you know uh the scientific community
01:05:06.400 should be the ones in charge or you know
01:05:09.760 charge the research of this and
01:05:11.200 everything
01:05:12.160 what name would you put out who do you
01:05:13.599 think would be qualified enough
01:05:15.680 to have a group like that you know um as
01:05:17.839 far as
01:05:18.799 being able to decipher what's going on
01:05:21.039 you know and stuff like that do you have
01:05:22.799 any names you could fill out
01:05:24.319 uh yeah they're friends essentially that
01:05:26.799 i've worked with before but i know what
01:05:28.400 their expertise is actual qualifications
01:05:30.480 go and so forth like that and do you
01:05:32.079 think that the names you come up with
01:05:33.359 they get along enough to get along well
01:05:35.440 enough to be well one of them was joe
01:05:37.680 beninetti a guy that i worked with in
01:05:39.119 los alamos one of my colleagues and uh
01:05:41.760 i was trying to force his resume on them
01:05:45.280 and uh you know they did take it and
01:05:47.039 look at it and i was kind of hoping that
01:05:48.480 he would he would be a big bone to
01:05:50.880 the project but
01:05:53.119 you know i already left by the time
01:05:56.640 i would have had to look at it
01:06:00.720 concerning local sightings here
01:06:04.160 i've personally seen
01:06:06.640 two at one time
01:06:08.319 maneuvering and along with the third one
01:06:10.559 later and they looked and performed
01:06:12.640 exactly like your video that you took
01:06:14.720 that night
01:06:16.720 now not to i'm not attacking anyone
01:06:19.280 that's had sightings but uh you know
01:06:21.520 there are a lot of
01:06:24.880 there's a lot of atmospheric phenomena
01:06:27.119 that can relate to i needed to sound
01:06:28.720 like middle class
01:06:40.400 what's that guy's name uh
01:06:44.799 glenn campbell i wrote that area for
01:06:46.400 only one guide and uh brought up uh i
01:06:48.720 don't think he believes my story but uh
01:06:51.359 i think he uh
01:06:53.520 brought up some very good points in
01:06:54.960 there and that a lot of that stuff could
01:06:56.559 be mistaken and uh if you're looking at
01:06:58.960 something with the naked eye a lot of
01:07:00.799 times it can look like it jumps around
01:07:02.720 and things like that especially if
01:07:04.000 you're staring at it for a long time uh
01:07:06.160 it all depends it all depends how it's
01:07:07.760 like that obviously but something
01:07:09.039 dramatic if something is close something
01:07:10.720 makes a tremendous jump a great distance
01:07:14.000 other than a little you know tiny white
01:07:16.160 light that looks like the head of a pen
01:07:17.839 that's a different story you know if
01:07:20.000 that's what you saw then that remains
01:07:22.079 unexplained well that's what i'm
01:07:23.599 referring to because it was very close
01:07:25.599 both of them were very close
01:07:27.359 and they would get brighter and darker
01:07:29.440 just like in your videos they sometimes
01:07:31.680 almost strode and they were down on the
01:07:34.160 ground
01:07:35.760 got right took off and moved around and
01:07:38.079 my main question
01:07:39.440 is
01:07:49.680 now they can't shut them off what
01:07:50.960 happened is the craft probably pitched
01:07:52.400 with the bottom towards you and it
01:07:53.680 looked like the light was off because
01:07:54.799 you can't see the light from the bottom
01:07:59.280 two questions one is nuts and bolts but
01:08:01.520 why do they generate light
01:08:03.440 why
01:08:04.240 why do you see any light at all well
01:08:06.319 to just answer that one first is
01:08:09.680 that's essentially operating like a
01:08:11.200 fluorescent tube anywhere you have uh
01:08:13.440 you can take a lar a powerful radio
01:08:15.280 transmitter and you take a neon tube
01:08:16.799 when you bring it near it it's gonna
01:08:17.920 light up just because the uh the atoms
01:08:20.080 are getting excited and certainly
01:08:23.198 right you know the electrons go to a
01:08:24.560 high energy state you drop down and
01:08:26.000 release a photon and that's what's going
01:08:27.520 on okay and secondly just to change the
01:08:29.198 venue and force you to speculate now
01:08:31.439 that you have some time to think back on
01:08:32.960 something do you want to elaborate
01:08:34.560 anymore on your
01:08:36.399 your ideas what containers are
01:08:38.719 and why we are referring to containers
01:08:40.719 in some past containers
01:08:42.960 i i can't even guess you know all i can
01:08:45.120 say is exactly the way it was written
01:08:47.120 and you know it because as soon as i
01:08:49.040 speculate on something you know it's
01:08:51.359 people are going to lean towards that
01:08:52.479 way and it's not fair did those
01:08:54.080 documents at all inscribe a purpose to
01:08:56.238 why these genetic manipulations were
01:08:58.000 being done
01:09:00.000 you know this was not a large briefing i
01:09:01.759 had 90 percent of the material that i
01:09:04.158 read was dealing with my project and
01:09:05.920 when i mean briefings i mean two sheets
01:09:07.520 of paper
01:09:08.799 as the uh just the information i got on
01:09:11.120 whatever else was going on probably to
01:09:12.799 alleviate you know my curiosity and that
01:09:14.880 was about it
01:09:22.479 now the aurora i did see once on the way
01:09:24.399 out there and the only reason i say it's
01:09:26.080 the aurora is uh
01:09:28.319 i uh i was told it by dennis and the bus
01:09:31.520 it makes an unbelievably loud sound and
01:09:35.120 uh i
01:09:36.479 think when i heard it i said it sounds
01:09:38.000 like the sky is tearing
01:09:39.839 and from what i understand it operates
01:09:41.920 on a liquid methane powered engine
01:09:44.158 there's a lot of information has gotten
01:09:45.839 out in
01:09:47.679 aviation week in popular science and
01:09:50.399 it looked if this in fact was aurora it
01:09:52.399 was certainly a strange aircraft it
01:09:54.080 looked like if you know what the old
01:09:55.120 x-15 looked like a very long slender
01:09:57.280 craft with short wings on it and a
01:09:59.840 square exhaust that had little veins in
01:10:02.480 it
01:10:03.840 is it quite large
01:10:05.520 is it large
01:10:06.800 yes it's quite large it's a really
01:10:09.120 overgrown thing and uh
01:10:12.239 there are a couple people that came up
01:10:13.600 who i described the sound to one of them
01:10:15.360 was uh
01:10:17.760 john andrews from the testers model
01:10:19.360 corporation and they're always spying
01:10:20.880 around to make the most recent models of
01:10:22.800 a stealth and things like that and he
01:10:24.719 heard the exact sound that i described
01:10:26.640 unfortunately he couldn't record it but
01:10:28.239 that really got him lit up and
01:10:30.719 he probably has more information about
01:10:32.080 it than i do
01:10:38.000 okay quick
01:10:39.520 when you listen to some abduction
01:10:40.719 reports whether or not people believe it
01:10:42.080 or not this is a common thread of people
01:10:43.920 being moved by blue beams of light
01:10:46.400 uh
01:10:47.440 did you ever talk to anybody in your
01:10:48.880 work about technology that could explain
01:10:51.199 that or is there extrapolation of
01:10:52.800 ulcerative systems that you worked on
01:10:54.480 that could explain something any of the
01:10:55.920 three gravity amplifiers could do that
01:10:57.600 could lift something off the ground or
01:10:59.199 for that matter compacted into the
01:11:00.560 ground that's not a problem because the
01:11:02.480 craft in fact can operate on one
01:11:05.280 amplifier in omicron mode hovering that
01:11:07.360 would leave the other two amplifiers
01:11:08.719 free to do anything so i imagine they
01:11:10.640 could pick up cows or whatever else they
01:11:12.400 want to do but you know the craft that i
01:11:14.239 worked on there there was actually no
01:11:15.760 provision
01:11:17.120 for anything to come in through the
01:11:18.560 bottom of the craft
01:11:20.640 or anything along those lines so i i
01:11:22.560 don't know how if that in fact happens
01:11:24.800 in a completely different type of craft
01:11:26.480 does it sound is a blue color consistent
01:11:29.120 with what you would expect
01:11:30.880 that's more consistent than the grass
01:11:32.400 glowing orange
01:11:33.920 because you know the interaction of the
01:11:35.360 it should
01:11:36.480 the you know nitrogen atmosphere
01:11:39.600 ship appear to be
01:11:42.400 a piece of metal
01:11:43.760 not cast at least mark it was injection
01:11:45.600 molded because there was no sharp
01:11:46.719 objects even where the seats meet the
01:11:48.320 floor is curved the top of everything
01:11:52.320 i think the analogy i gave it looked
01:11:53.920 like it was completely made of wax and
01:11:55.440 heated till it melted
01:11:57.280 and then cooled down everything is
01:11:58.800 completely perfectly rounded and
01:12:01.760 if in fact you're talking about
01:12:03.120 something that's uh containing a high
01:12:06.239 voltage feel that's exactly what you
01:12:07.760 want to have to help prevent the corona
01:12:10.239 discharge from spraying off
01:12:12.159 how can you focus a gravity wave on
01:12:14.800 something that's so many millions and
01:12:16.400 millions of miles away well first of all
01:12:18.320 i don't think they focus it that far
01:12:19.760 away okay i was talking to with someone
01:12:22.400 else uh
01:12:24.159 i think these trips were made in several
01:12:26.080 small jumps
01:12:27.760 because the amount of energy required to
01:12:29.360 do something like that in the
01:12:31.120 it's not really that not the amount of
01:12:32.640 energy but if you're looking at three
01:12:34.480 amplifiers
01:12:36.159 that focus down to something the size of
01:12:38.800 a tennis ball
01:12:40.880 that the amount of precision that's
01:12:42.719 required to move the amplifier
01:12:45.040 with minimal deviation out there
01:12:47.040 eventually is going to exceed anyone's
01:12:49.120 level of technology so if you're doing a
01:12:51.600 jump
01:12:53.760 of
01:12:54.480 a thousand miles i mean that's
01:12:57.440 tremendously impressive if you're doing
01:12:59.040 a job you know i can't see them jumping
01:13:01.040 a light here much less 30.
01:13:03.040 it just doesn't seem possible
01:13:16.960 i never heard of them
01:13:20.480 in the
01:13:21.679 video surrounding ufos and mexico city
01:13:24.159 during the eclipse there's some very
01:13:26.000 remarkable
01:13:27.760 video of a pulsation
01:13:30.400 of some sort of field surrounding these
01:13:32.640 ufos would that be an attribute would
01:13:34.960 that be attributable to the type of
01:13:36.800 technology that you saw
01:13:38.560 it's possible an optical
01:13:40.640 distortion absolutely you saw a pulse
01:13:43.360 and the polarization of the pole seems
01:13:45.120 to be changing as well
01:13:47.440 that's certainly possible
01:13:51.679 yeah in your videos
01:14:16.960 yeah apparently whatever
01:14:18.960 i don't know what else to call it other
01:14:20.480 than some sort of anesthetizing
01:14:23.679 hypnosis along those lines but anything
01:14:25.920 that distracts attention uh
01:14:28.800 at a high level and you know certainly
01:14:31.679 uh you know some sort of stimulant drug
01:14:34.000 or something uh that gets someone riled
01:14:36.800 up would
01:14:37.920 not
01:14:38.800 permit that to happen it's just like in
01:14:40.640 modern hypnosis or
01:14:42.400 not really modern hypnosis but in
01:14:43.920 hypnosis in general if you're not in a
01:14:45.600 relaxed state you're not you're not
01:14:46.960 going to get into that level of
01:14:48.080 consciousness so
01:14:49.600 uh
01:14:50.719 you know if you're in a very alert awake
01:14:52.719 state it's going to be hard to
01:14:55.280 you know
01:14:56.480 cause that effect if you know again if
01:14:58.719 in fact that is correct information what
01:15:00.960 context was that information
01:15:04.239 that dealt with some of the biological
01:15:06.159 effects
01:15:07.760 of the uh
01:15:09.679 of the aliens on
01:15:12.480 i think essentially on the human race is
01:15:14.080 what it was uh is how it was termed it
01:15:16.880 it
01:15:17.679 this was in i think it was in part of
01:15:19.280 the autopsy reports because they had
01:15:21.440 the single organ they had in their body
01:15:23.679 uh cross-sectioned and and split up and
01:15:26.640 i think there were there was a
01:15:29.440 comments in there about what different
01:15:30.800 functions of the brains are and i think
01:15:32.239 that's where this came up is that
01:15:33.600 they're trying to relate
01:15:35.120 some unknown lobe with a brain
01:15:37.360 to uh to this function but that's so
01:15:39.840 typical there again you know like in
01:15:41.600 particle physics we don't know what it
01:15:42.960 is so hey that's what does it you know
01:15:44.640 it's not necessarily true
01:15:48.080 uh yes uh i i hope you'll be offended by
01:15:51.199 this question and i i have to ask it to
01:15:54.239 verify your bona fides uh have you ever
01:15:57.520 gone up by any other name
01:16:00.800 i ever gone by any other name
01:16:03.440 no no
01:16:09.760 as far as i know
01:16:19.120 information on um aliens besides that
01:16:20.960 they have one organ
01:16:23.040 no that's all i have and that was uh
01:16:24.960 essentially just from looking at a
01:16:26.159 photograph
01:16:27.600 so we don't know if they eat or drink or
01:16:30.080 they probably do but i don't
01:16:33.040 this is really just a comment because
01:16:34.800 you mentioned
01:16:36.159 how you feel about billy meyer
01:16:38.400 that little scene but
01:16:40.480 you said that the craft that you worked
01:16:42.800 on looks just like the craft that from
01:16:45.760 the philly meyer one of them yeah
01:16:48.000 however um
01:16:50.080 the beings that billy myers supposedly
01:16:53.520 was in contact with are supposedly
01:16:56.159 full-sized like average human beings
01:16:59.760 and you said that the staff
01:17:06.480 but if you look at the billy myers
01:17:07.920 information i think somewhere in there
01:17:10.239 maybe i've got this wrong because so
01:17:11.679 much stuff has gone through my head that
01:17:14.000 they the people of large people and
01:17:15.920 apparently flew that craft did not
01:17:17.520 produce the craft they think billy meyer
01:17:20.000 said it was uh
01:17:21.679 it was obtained from creatures that were
01:17:23.600 two meters tall or a meter tall or
01:17:25.360 something along those lines which craft
01:17:26.960 was that the fact that they did
01:17:34.320 during those contests well so are our
01:17:36.560 guys for that matter so i imagine they
01:17:38.159 could be retrofitted but
01:17:40.239 you know i
01:17:41.840 i don't know i can't go either way i i
01:17:43.679 know the one that i worked on was small
01:17:45.760 and was certainly uncomfortable for you
01:17:48.320 know anything in the area five to six
01:17:50.159 feet to walk around
01:17:58.080 i don't know that's information that uh
01:18:00.320 you know wasn't given
01:18:02.560 but i did
01:18:03.520 i think as i said on my tape and an
01:18:05.600 interview somewhere one of them
01:18:07.600 absolutely had a projectile hole through
01:18:09.520 it and uh the only thing i don't believe
01:18:12.000 it was shot down this is a personal
01:18:13.760 belief
01:18:14.800 but uh
01:18:16.480 more along the lines i believe it was
01:18:17.760 stood up on its side just to see you
01:18:19.679 know how the metal would react to a
01:18:21.120 high-speed projectile going through it
01:18:24.480 you were you were there for what four to
01:18:26.800 six months yeah um you had a lot of
01:18:29.760 contact with security obviously yeah too
01:18:32.320 much
01:18:33.120 too much
01:18:36.080 how did they act
01:18:37.600 each one goes
01:18:42.320 they only went so far you know if i
01:18:44.480 walked if i was in the lab area and i
01:18:46.960 went to the bathroom the guy that came
01:18:49.120 with me or that was by the door went to
01:18:51.120 the bathroom he would go so far and if i
01:18:53.440 was leaving the perimeter somewhat there
01:18:55.440 would be another guy that went from that
01:18:56.880 distance on
01:18:59.440 was the army air force can you tell i
01:19:02.640 don't know any insignias on his uniform
01:19:05.520 no it might have been like i said they
01:19:07.280 had a dark blue uniform most of the guys
01:19:09.120 there except a few of the people outside
01:19:10.960 had that desert camo
01:19:12.560 it's like ear bray cap
01:19:16.320 no they didn't have any hats on
01:19:18.400 there wasn't any in sydney or anything
01:19:19.840 on them
01:19:24.320 yeah there might have been but you know
01:19:26.239 at the time i probably didn't pay much
01:19:27.679 attention to it i was trying to put the
01:19:28.880 guy in my mind though
01:19:30.719 they never wanted to talk to you
01:19:32.400 they all seemed like a stern uh delta
01:19:34.880 force pipe or were they like oh yeah
01:19:37.760 yeah they weren't the least bit
01:19:38.800 interested in what was going on and
01:19:40.640 you know what they've been briefed on i
01:19:42.080 have no idea but
01:19:44.800 you know to them it seemed like we were
01:19:46.480 a nuisance
01:19:48.159 but you know it's the reason that
01:19:49.600 they're there so i don't know
01:19:52.159 did you ever see any inside hardware
01:19:54.320 this machine
01:19:55.679 the nuts and bolts wires
01:19:59.280 and obviously what we did did it look
01:20:01.600 like our nuts and bolts and wires we get
01:20:03.280 in the hardware store well as far as
01:20:04.880 fastening devices everything was
01:20:07.440 formed together there were no nuts and
01:20:08.960 bolts
01:20:09.840 uh wires there were no connecting wires
01:20:11.920 even between electrical systems
01:20:14.320 um so what
01:20:17.120 what was the course of energy how did it
01:20:19.679 go from one
01:20:21.199 area to another area
01:20:23.120 the best guess is essentially an
01:20:24.480 operator like a tesla coil does
01:20:29.360 a transmitter and essentially a receiver
01:20:31.280 tuned to the transmitting frequency and
01:20:33.040 receives the electrical power and you
01:20:34.400 know there again that's not
01:20:36.000 real advanced technology tesla did that
01:20:38.000 in the 30s lights on a console were they
01:20:40.639 plastic no i don't like it
01:20:53.280 yes
01:20:56.159 the uh could you recount for us and
01:20:57.840 detail uh your memory of what happened
01:20:59.920 the night that you and the group of
01:21:01.920 people were discovered on the perimeter
01:21:03.920 of the uh you know the viewing area
01:21:05.679 where you saw the captain
01:21:07.280 i bet john larry
01:21:09.360 no no it just uh it was compelling and i
01:21:11.600 just would be curious to hear
01:21:13.360 when he
01:21:14.239 in particular there was one aspect of
01:21:15.840 the story he said evidently when they
01:21:18.080 were
01:21:19.040 vehicles with
01:21:20.320 some ten
01:21:21.679 unmarked broncos were how many
01:21:24.239 he said five on each side of the road
01:21:27.199 it must have been a different time you
01:21:29.440 know
01:21:30.159 you jumped from the either jumped in the
01:21:31.760 car or left the occupants of the car to
01:21:34.880 go out into the desert so that you
01:21:36.080 wouldn't have discovered it amongst the
01:21:37.280 people there when you returned that's
01:21:38.560 true
01:21:42.880 we uh
01:21:43.920 we drove out well i mean john lear is a
01:21:46.000 nice guy and i like him but you know he
01:21:47.840 does have the
01:21:48.880 tendency to add about 15 percent color
01:21:51.120 to stories and if a story goes through
01:21:53.199 them twice it's 30 percent
01:22:06.800 my wife at the time and her
01:22:09.120 sister
01:22:10.880 were going to go out
01:22:12.639 and see what we could see because there
01:22:13.760 was a test flight coming up
01:22:15.520 and
01:22:18.719 john knew that we were up to something
01:22:21.520 because we didn't invite him in and he
01:22:23.199 showed up at the house and said okay you
01:22:24.800 know well we're going and you know come
01:22:26.480 on
01:22:27.120 um
01:22:28.320 we had rented a car because the only
01:22:30.320 reason we rented a car was because
01:22:33.520 sister-in-law was in from out of town
01:22:35.120 all i've ever owned usually the sports
01:22:36.719 cars they see two people and uh
01:22:39.280 and that's all we had so we had rented a
01:22:40.960 car and we all piled into that and uh
01:22:44.880 we drove out there i don't remember what
01:22:46.400 time we got there in it
01:22:48.400 but
01:22:49.600 it got dark we waited right till dusk to
01:22:51.760 drive up the road
01:22:54.239 and we got
01:22:55.679 probably about
01:22:57.920 seven miles in i think
01:23:00.239 and we were very careful not to hit the
01:23:02.000 brakes because we didn't want the lights
01:23:03.679 going on because we knew there by
01:23:05.040 watching up on the road beforehand we
01:23:06.560 knew there were security guys running
01:23:08.320 around just looking is the mailbox road
01:23:10.719 no i've never been on a mailbox truck
01:23:13.040 that's the only brew road that okay you
01:23:15.199 know big one that goes up there well
01:23:16.560 it's probably on mailbox road but i
01:23:18.159 didn't watch anything from there um
01:23:21.360 we drove in probably about five to seven
01:23:23.440 miles and
01:23:25.840 i had brought we brought all kinds of
01:23:27.600 stuff with us we bought
01:23:28.960 geiger counters we bought a celestron
01:23:31.040 10-inch telescope
01:23:32.880 i brought a nine millimeter pistol
01:23:35.120 because i didn't i really didn't want to
01:23:37.520 get caught
01:23:38.719 and
01:23:41.679 we came up there and as we stopped the
01:23:43.760 car
01:23:45.440 uh
01:23:46.400 my sister-in-law was driving she stepped
01:23:48.239 on the brakes
01:23:50.080 and so we stopped right there and just
01:23:52.000 waited we didn't see any reaction
01:23:54.400 and then somebody opened the door and
01:23:56.080 the dome light went on and as soon as
01:23:57.920 that happened two different sets of
01:23:59.760 headlights lit up on either side of us
01:24:02.159 and we said that's it we're dead so
01:24:04.880 uh
01:24:05.840 i went in the truck and i got my pistol
01:24:07.600 and i went out to the desert
01:24:09.360 they were far enough away oh no what
01:24:10.719 happened i got there we we hopped in the
01:24:12.800 car and then started really all in ass
01:24:14.639 back to the exit i think if we get to
01:24:16.159 the road in time you know we're out of
01:24:17.280 there too jurisdiction there's no
01:24:18.719 problem so we got about halfway up there
01:24:20.560 and i think there were three
01:24:22.719 vehicles maximum
01:24:25.120 i stopped and you know we figured we're
01:24:26.880 not getting out of there because uh as
01:24:29.040 we're getting close to the top of the
01:24:30.320 road you can see another vehicle pull in
01:24:32.080 i said well yeah we're trapped so i got
01:24:34.239 off and ran out to the desert
01:24:36.719 uh
01:24:37.600 now the rest of the story
01:24:39.600 is from the people that were there
01:24:41.600 because i was out in the desert laying
01:24:43.280 down on the ground
01:24:44.960 supposedly what happened was uh
01:24:48.000 these guys came out
01:24:50.159 john set up the telescope real fast
01:24:52.639 and um
01:24:55.600 that was the best excuse up with that's
01:24:57.679 right and uh the guys came over and said
01:25:00.639 i think john interrupted him say hey
01:25:02.320 what are you guys trying to do a drug
01:25:03.679 deal or something did we interrupt
01:25:04.880 something and you know they kind of just
01:25:06.239 shrugged that off and john said well
01:25:07.840 we're looking at jupiter and
01:25:09.840 uh you know they said what are you guys
01:25:11.360 doing out here they just ignored
01:25:12.719 whatever he had to say and
01:25:14.880 went on for a while i don't remember the
01:25:16.639 conversation because i wasn't wasn't
01:25:18.320 there but uh
01:25:20.320 now it was pitch black you couldn't see
01:25:22.080 your hand in front of crazy it was a
01:25:23.199 moonless night and they said all right
01:25:25.120 we'll just get the hell out of here
01:25:27.440 they backed off down the road and they
01:25:29.280 stopped but we didn't know that and
01:25:31.199 turned around you can see all this
01:25:32.960 happening right because no my head was
01:25:35.040 down i didn't want my glasses or my
01:25:37.199 white face
01:25:39.120 uh a few hundred yards away our yards
01:25:41.120 where they had stopped no one knew this
01:25:42.639 at the time and i came back
01:25:44.880 you know out of the desert and uh
01:25:47.120 yeah i'm usually very sarcastic and joke
01:25:49.600 around and uh
01:25:51.120 what i said was gene huff was standing
01:25:53.120 there and i said man we're lucky those
01:25:55.040 guys didn't see the other 50 delta force
01:25:56.960 we had out there or something along
01:25:58.159 those lines you know that could have
01:25:59.440 taken him out at any time and he laughed
01:26:01.040 you know it was just i don't remember
01:26:02.000 the exact content of the joke but uh
01:26:04.320 those guys heard that
01:26:06.400 and they're sitting there watching us so
01:26:08.000 i guess now i've learned about most of
01:26:09.760 this from the debriefing afterwards they
01:26:11.280 took me in so
01:26:13.280 the guys that were there were on top of
01:26:15.679 the truck or jeep they had and they went
01:26:17.280 to arms because they thought there were
01:26:18.880 guys standing out there so they had us
01:26:20.560 all under gunpoint we didn't know what
01:26:21.760 was going on and we're sitting there
01:26:24.320 talking about everything that had
01:26:26.000 happened flying saucers and all that
01:26:27.679 stuff sitting on the bumper
01:26:29.199 and we're just looking off down the road
01:26:31.360 and we'd see a little green light drop
01:26:33.199 on the ground and roll around and it was
01:26:34.719 a night vision scope and someone picks
01:26:36.400 it up and it disappears and you know we
01:26:38.719 all said well let's get the hell out of
01:26:40.320 here what's that what happened except
01:26:41.920 one of the guards that dropped a night
01:26:43.120 vision scope and it rolled on the ground
01:26:44.639 and we could see the little green image
01:26:46.960 rolling around and you see it pick up
01:26:48.480 and you know disappear and it was only
01:26:50.639 like from here to the you know the
01:26:52.719 netting over there that was the distance
01:26:54.480 because it was completely dark wow and
01:26:56.400 uh so we got scared and you know as soon
01:26:58.159 as we got in the car we all agreed
01:26:59.840 they're right there you know and they
01:27:01.199 heard everything so
01:27:02.719 we took off and we got to the you know
01:27:04.560 top of the road and lincoln county
01:27:05.920 sheriff was there
01:27:07.920 and that was another major hassle so
01:27:10.480 he wanted to search the car we wouldn't
01:27:12.080 let him and he was in radio contact with
01:27:13.840 the base for these guys out there and
01:27:16.639 they said where did the extra guy come
01:27:18.639 from
01:27:20.400 and you know that completely confused
01:27:22.080 them because they had never i guess they
01:27:23.440 had never seen me
01:27:24.960 come up or something like that they
01:27:26.239 thought i was another guy that walked
01:27:27.520 around however can anyway the big
01:27:29.280 problem was that there was another guy
01:27:30.960 and
01:27:31.679 i think legally they can only hold you
01:27:33.120 there for an hour
01:27:34.400 and we were there for like 59 minutes
01:27:36.239 and he said you know okay go but you
01:27:38.080 know he really wanted to search well i
01:27:40.400 gotta back track of that john lehrer
01:27:41.920 made the colossal mistake we were under
01:27:44.480 just minimal suspicion at the time and
01:27:46.159 he asked for everyone's id
01:27:48.159 and in the trunk we had everything the
01:27:50.239 guyer counters and all that stuff and
01:27:52.560 you know the the people that didn't want
01:27:54.320 to show their id he said well we don't
01:27:55.520 have it we left it at home and the other
01:27:56.800 ones that did you know took it out and
01:27:58.639 john said wait mine's in the trunk and
01:28:00.719 he opens the trunk and here's all the
01:28:02.480 stuff laying there and that's that's
01:28:04.000 what the cop decided to keep us for a
01:28:05.520 long time we've always hassled john
01:28:07.280 about that forever
01:28:08.960 and uh he said so you guys are out here
01:28:10.639 with a geiger counter a telescope and
01:28:12.480 all this other hardware sound equipment
01:28:14.080 and video stuff and you're just out
01:28:16.000 you know just out walking around and you
01:28:17.520 know we all said yeah and
01:28:19.120 you know so that's when he kept us and
01:28:20.880 that's that's really what happened that
01:28:22.400 day and the following day was a work day
01:28:24.639 for me but i was taken into debriefing
01:28:26.880 and
01:28:31.280 right well that was uh that was kind of
01:28:33.199 a turning point
01:28:34.800 you fired them you officially fired no i
01:28:37.199 was never fired see at the time they
01:28:39.199 were going to pull my clearance before
01:28:40.840 that so it's i don't know if that was
01:28:42.960 ever clear the main reason
01:28:45.360 was
01:28:46.560 for me not progressing any further there
01:28:49.440 was they halted my clearance because at
01:28:51.120 the time i had
01:28:53.040 my phone was being tapped and i i
01:28:54.719 allowed that i signed the uh
01:28:56.880 the order to do that and i'm going
01:28:58.560 through my background and
01:29:00.400 uh you know at the time i
01:29:02.800 you know didn't tell my wife what was
01:29:04.159 going on until later and you know
01:29:06.880 as things progressed but
01:29:09.360 she was having an affair with somebody
01:29:11.600 on the phone
01:29:13.840 and i was her flight instructor that i
01:29:15.600 was paying for playing lessons
01:29:19.280 as uh this was going on just like in you
01:29:21.760 know the astronaut program not only do
01:29:23.600 you have to have you know security as
01:29:25.440 far as and no connection to foreign
01:29:27.040 governments or things like that but as
01:29:28.320 far as your family life it has to be
01:29:29.679 stable because they don't want any you
01:29:30.880 know loose cannons running around
01:29:32.880 so this was going on i had no knowledge
01:29:34.960 of it
01:29:35.920 and they said well you know we're gonna
01:29:38.400 what they're gonna do is not say
01:29:39.440 anything to me and wait until
01:29:42.480 one way or another the situation
01:29:44.080 resolved itself either you know my wife
01:29:46.560 took off or you know
01:29:48.239 you know
01:29:49.360 came to an end or whatever
01:29:51.280 so when i was in uh
01:29:54.080 debriefing essentially that day you know
01:29:55.600 this is when they really
01:29:57.120 started attacking me and hassling me and
01:29:58.719 that's when they took out the phone
01:30:00.000 transcripts you know by the way bob your
01:30:01.840 wife's somebody and that was
01:30:04.400 the last time i
01:30:12.000 so that was
01:30:13.600 just been just pretty bowled over
01:30:25.360 yeah but not that really changes
01:30:27.120 anything
01:30:28.400 it's the same thing it's just little
01:30:29.679 technical things that
01:30:32.080 no it's really not worth bringing up
01:30:36.480 real quick did you see the paperwork and
01:30:38.480 how they got
01:30:39.760 got the discs to start with
01:30:42.320 no
01:30:43.520 that's pure speculation
01:30:46.239 what did you have the geiger coverage
01:30:47.600 for and do you believe that are there
01:30:49.440 dangerous levels of radiation uh in this
01:30:51.760 area because of testing that you they
01:30:53.600 did previously now at least at this
01:30:55.600 point we just i think we wanted to see
01:30:57.280 the background level and
01:31:01.040 yeah i don't uh it was just like a
01:31:03.040 staple to take along with it you know
01:31:04.960 it's probably i understand that this
01:31:06.320 area is just high for radiation
01:31:08.400 radioactivity the background levels are
01:31:10.560 high interior is that true
01:31:12.880 i don't know we had the geiger counter
01:31:14.320 but before i got to measure the
01:31:15.440 background i don't i don't know what it
01:31:17.199 was
01:31:18.239 bob this might be important because
01:31:19.520 jacques vallee is such stature and he's
01:31:21.600 trying to debunk you on the basis of
01:31:24.239 your supposedly he's telling your report
01:31:26.159 is only that you saw a dvm
01:31:28.400 and an oscilloscope at s4 as far as the
01:31:31.440 equipment there yeah
01:31:33.360 this is another thing that's gotten so
01:31:34.960 twisted she's actually
01:31:36.719 who's a ufo writer or something um
01:31:41.520 came to see me in las vegas i don't
01:31:43.360 remember how long ago it was but after
01:31:45.040 the george knapp thing and um
01:31:48.159 he came down with some producers from
01:31:50.400 universal studios who was going to make
01:31:52.000 a movie about his um
01:31:54.320 his book intruders or not intruders
01:31:56.480 that's something else
01:31:59.120 anyway they came down with him and they
01:32:01.199 said well we want to know what you think
01:32:03.040 of this and uh
01:32:05.600 you know just give us your opinion if
01:32:06.960 this jives and
01:32:08.400 i looked at the information and he
01:32:09.840 explained it to me and i said that
01:32:11.600 has nothing to do with the craft that i
01:32:12.960 worked on or any of the technology that
01:32:14.960 i was involved in
01:32:16.400 period
01:32:17.360 and
01:32:18.320 jack really didn't appreciate that but
01:32:20.639 they asked for my opinion so i said and
01:32:23.120 you know as far as the conclusions he's
01:32:24.800 drawn i don't agree with him i think
01:32:25.920 they're completely wrong and so on and
01:32:27.440 so forth so he really didn't like me
01:32:29.440 after that point so he began to
01:32:31.360 interview me and he said well what did
01:32:32.719 you do here and here and i went over
01:32:34.400 things and there's one and this is on
01:32:36.560 tape i don't see why he would even make
01:32:38.320 a fuss about it but he said well well
01:32:40.159 what kind of equipment did you have to
01:32:41.840 work with and i said a wide variety of
01:32:44.560 you know of different things he said
01:32:46.159 well what about your bench what was on
01:32:47.679 your bench i said
01:32:49.120 anything you'd find in a normal tech
01:32:50.639 bench i said oscilloscopes dvms things
01:32:52.880 like that and he said okay and then you
01:32:54.960 know later i heard through the grapevine
01:32:56.560 that he's out doing election bob lazar
01:32:58.560 said he's back engineer of the flying
01:32:59.920 saucers with an oscilloscope and a ddm
01:33:03.360 it was on tape and i i think a lot of
01:33:05.199 that's he's really pretty pissed at me
01:33:08.159 for shooting down the movie but i had no
01:33:09.840 idea that was going to be the effect or
01:33:11.360 although i would have reserved my
01:33:12.719 opinion
01:33:14.560 that's just the way it goes
01:33:18.080 what was the physical layout of the
01:33:20.480 compound where you worked at like
01:33:23.199 did you describe it
01:33:25.280 uh it was long it was about up the side
01:33:27.120 on the side of the mountain range there
01:33:29.520 uh all the hangar doors went alongside
01:33:32.159 and there's a long corridor that goes
01:33:33.840 down
01:33:34.800 in back of the hangers
01:33:37.440 off that corridor comes
01:33:40.560 several rooms only two or three of which
01:33:42.400 i've been in the medical area the
01:33:45.679 lab that i work in and then there's a
01:33:47.760 small little room where i write some
01:33:49.040 briefings some things along those lines
01:33:50.639 but i've been in any of the other rooms
01:33:52.800 or know if there are things behind it or
01:33:54.800 underneath it so that's that's all i can
01:33:57.199 help you with on that
01:33:58.960 um
01:33:59.840 last night
01:34:01.520 john lear said that you
01:34:04.400 really didn't believe that there was
01:34:05.840 anything
01:34:06.880 unusual going on in those space shuttle
01:34:09.679 shots you thought it was ice particles
01:34:11.760 you know these ones they've been
01:34:13.520 claiming our
01:34:16.840 uh that's not nice it's dusk
01:34:19.840 oh dust whatever there's no fans or
01:34:21.920 butts about that you know that's uh have
01:34:23.840 you seen the hoagland
01:34:25.840 yeah i've seen the whole thing
01:34:27.280 a copy from nasa and it's uh you know
01:34:29.520 unfortunately it would be neat if they
01:34:31.440 were flying south but if you see a
01:34:32.800 bright white flash first that's the
01:34:34.480 positioning thruster firing on the left
01:34:36.639 side of the shuttle the shuttle didn't
01:34:38.080 change no it doesn't it it normally
01:34:40.239 doesn't do that you know they
01:34:42.480 those are station keeping thrusters and
01:34:44.159 that it all depends if the thruster is
01:34:46.800 firing in the direction of the shuttle
01:34:48.400 keeping its forward momentum there'll be
01:34:49.840 no attitude change that's only if
01:34:51.440 they're firing a pitch rocket well you
01:34:52.880 see a change like that and the fact that
01:34:55.040 it flew forward means it was firing in
01:34:57.199 the direction of the shuttle so those
01:34:59.040 little dots and things you see i mean i
01:35:00.719 firmly believe because i've seen other
01:35:02.560 things along those lines are right on
01:35:04.159 the lens they're not on the horizon
01:35:05.520 that's why you see a flash there's a
01:35:07.440 delay and then particles that are
01:35:09.040 normally floating in space you see dart
01:35:10.560 off like that because of the delay time
01:35:12.239 from that and
01:35:13.360 you know until i see something else that
01:35:15.280 uh leads me to believe this i know it it
01:35:18.239 looked neat you know like there was a
01:35:20.000 flash and something came up from the
01:35:21.360 ground but if you just watch that and
01:35:23.440 think that these are right against the
01:35:25.040 lens and that right flash is one of the
01:35:28.480 uh thrusters firing that uh you know
01:35:30.400 you'll probably have a different opinion
01:35:31.679 of it but what about the right angle
01:35:33.280 move it's a 45 degree turn which means
01:35:35.440 it has to stop
01:35:36.880 you're talking about little dust
01:35:37.840 particles that are moving and then when
01:35:39.280 the thrusts are fired you know it
01:35:40.800 doesn't there's there's no mass to them
01:35:42.239 and they reverse direction there's other
01:35:43.520 particles in the video that do the exact
01:35:45.360 same thing
01:35:46.800 yeah if you look at the whole video not
01:35:48.400 just the crop down there's all kinds of
01:35:50.159 junk floating around and when that
01:35:52.000 thruster fires there's about a one
01:35:53.600 second delay and everything goes flying
01:35:55.199 off exactly like you'd expect everything
01:35:57.040 goes flying off and drifting except for
01:35:58.880 one item that accelerates at like 10
01:36:01.280 times the speed of all the other items
01:36:03.119 in the video yeah but there's there's
01:36:05.280 have you seen copeland's detailed
01:36:07.360 breakdown
01:36:09.840 what about when
01:36:11.360 he's talking about the light coming
01:36:14.000 over the horizon of the planet under the
01:36:16.880 layer what he calls
01:36:18.719 and over the ionosphere
01:36:21.600 yeah but that doesn't
01:36:23.040 it still doesn't make sense it doesn't
01:36:25.760 take into account that something is
01:36:27.040 right on the camera lens
01:36:28.800 did the tape that you listened to did it
01:36:30.400 have the last transmission from
01:36:32.320 mission control
01:36:34.159 i really don't i don't remember no i'm
01:36:36.320 not standing on this like as an absolute
01:36:38.000 fact but from what i from what i've seen
01:36:40.239 most of the states have had the editor
01:36:43.600 heads up
01:36:45.440 which means pay attention and keep your
01:36:46.960 mouth shut
01:36:49.520 i don't know i mean that's that's my
01:36:50.960 opinion and i haven't
01:36:52.960 i haven't seen anything to fear me from
01:36:54.639 it but you know i always remain
01:36:56.159 open-minded but uh
01:37:00.719 i don't know that's all i can say
01:37:02.719 you mentioned the photon
01:37:05.360 earlier do you think physics is taking a
01:37:07.360 wrong turn by looking for exchange
01:37:09.440 particles were you thinking about the
01:37:11.440 strong force
01:37:13.920 not clear on why you're skeptical about
01:37:15.679 the ground
01:37:16.800 about the gravity time
01:37:23.840 no not necessarily i mean they make it
01:37:26.159 have one but
01:37:27.760 you know as time goes on that uh that
01:37:29.760 really hasn't held true
01:37:31.920 uh and you know the bottom line is they
01:37:34.159 don't
01:37:35.280 well first of all they don't even
01:37:36.320 believe there's a graviton anymore so
01:37:37.920 i'm not the only one
01:37:40.880 as far as exchange particles
01:37:44.000 you know still
01:37:45.840 though some of them like the zeta
01:37:47.119 particle maybe that's
01:37:49.199 maybe that's an actual thing but uh you
01:37:51.280 know when they're looking at transfers
01:37:52.480 of energy i think these are scapegoats
01:37:54.880 you know for the most part and uh you
01:37:56.719 know a lot of the experiments that i was
01:37:58.639 doing in los alamos uh essentially was
01:38:01.119 uh along these same lines but
01:38:04.000 you know other exchange particles like
01:38:05.440 the intermediate vector boson you know i
01:38:07.600 don't i don't believe that thing exists
01:38:09.440 i really don't i think they're grabbing
01:38:10.800 its straws and just come on with excuses
01:38:14.480 did you use or see any any kind of
01:38:16.800 drawing mechanical drawing or electrical
01:38:19.280 schematic
01:38:20.560 any kind of documentation
01:38:23.360 which you don't know
01:38:25.119 uh of what we do with the amplifier and
01:38:27.199 engineering layouts and things along
01:38:28.719 those lines and i've duplicated those
01:38:30.960 at home
01:38:40.480 is there a difference in
01:38:42.719 the
01:38:50.400 well zero gravity is ideally what it
01:38:52.080 wants i don't think it wants in
01:38:54.000 any other interactive gravity field
01:39:01.000 [Music]
01:39:06.719 1989 when i left
01:39:09.199 since it
01:39:10.960 be possible that is things could either
01:39:12.719 make themselves entirely invisible or a
01:39:14.639 field of invisibility by bending the
01:39:16.239 light around the outside of the ship
01:39:17.679 yeah
01:39:18.639 that's a byproduct of what's going on
01:39:20.400 because you know just as
01:39:23.440 any
01:39:24.480 large source of gravity bends light and
01:39:26.159 you get an intense focus source like
01:39:27.760 that and it's going to really distort it
01:39:31.920 directly like you just said that you've
01:39:33.679 duplicated the gravity amplifiers
01:39:36.320 some of the equipment muscles are drying
01:39:38.480 um
01:39:43.119 uh no i'm not testing it because i don't
01:39:45.119 know the facilities to do that but like
01:39:46.480 i mentioned to someone else earlier that
01:39:48.159 uh
01:39:49.119 this summer i'll be patenting those
01:39:51.280 drawings and that that device itself so
01:39:54.719 should anyone decide that all of a
01:39:56.480 sudden they discovered it and since
01:39:57.760 they've made no claim to it i'll have
01:39:59.119 them back you don't know about this
01:40:06.080 that's that's really part of the
01:40:07.679 federation the intergalactic patent
01:40:09.920 treaty doesn't know about that no i
01:40:11.360 didn't sign that that's right
01:40:16.000 yeah yeah sure
01:40:24.080 how do you build a gravity wave detector
01:40:27.119 let's say you can determine the
01:40:28.239 frequency
01:40:29.679 of the source direction of a gravity
01:40:31.600 wave emanating from a planet
01:40:34.080 and other source well actually gravity
01:40:36.239 wave detector is a tough thing to make
01:40:38.000 and uh
01:40:39.360 there are
01:40:40.639 there they are being made and
01:40:43.360 i don't exactly follow what they're
01:40:45.199 doing but i know the basis of what it is
01:40:47.360 it's a giant drum it's
01:40:49.920 20 or 30 feet long and it's filled with
01:40:51.760 dry cleaning fluid with carbon
01:40:53.199 tetrachloride in there and
01:40:55.520 it rotates and i haven't i never paid
01:40:57.280 much attention to it i have no idea how
01:40:59.040 that detects
01:41:00.400 a gravity wave but
01:41:02.000 there's
01:41:02.880 i think caltech has even funded funded
01:41:05.199 one of them well i mean the gravity ways
01:41:06.880 that you're talking about well gravity
01:41:08.639 waves are gravity right what about the
01:41:09.920 small gravity
01:41:12.560 what is the frequency
01:41:14.639 the well the frequency the
01:41:16.719 the actual reactor operates at is like
01:41:19.320 7.46 hertz it's a very low frequency
01:41:21.840 that's the frequency
01:41:23.280 or universally oil gravity that's the
01:41:25.199 frequency that the reactor operates at
01:41:28.639 did you use any computer process in the
01:41:31.119 control process
01:41:32.480 in the control process no i wasn't
01:41:34.719 affiliated with that
01:41:37.679 but why would you suppose that
01:41:39.920 that the government would continue to
01:41:42.239 spend these massive billions of dollars
01:41:47.679 on space projects
01:41:50.080 that are extended you know 20 years into
01:41:52.800 the future
01:41:53.920 when it knows it has this technology
01:41:56.239 that would make them all obsolete
01:42:02.560 oh i want to know why the government
01:42:03.920 would continue to spend millions and
01:42:06.320 billions i guess of dollars on space
01:42:08.159 projects when you know they have this
01:42:09.840 technology and uh well
01:42:11.760 first of all you're assuming that you
01:42:14.159 know the whole
01:42:15.600 the whole one of the government knows
01:42:17.040 what's going on and that's probably not
01:42:18.639 the case
01:42:19.920 nasa probably isn't aware of what's
01:42:21.360 going on here uh
01:42:23.600 second of all just because they have
01:42:25.040 this stuff they haven't you know they
01:42:27.119 haven't left the earth with it and they
01:42:28.480 won't so we still want to send things up
01:42:30.320 in orbit and uh that's the most
01:42:32.000 efficient we you know way we have doing
01:42:33.760 it is essentially building a big
01:42:34.960 firework to go up there
01:42:36.800 um you know if they spent the same money
01:42:38.800 in developing this technology or half
01:42:42.159 they they'd probably be able to not
01:42:44.000 necessarily you know sometimes all the
01:42:45.360 money in the world doesn't get you
01:42:46.560 anywhere you know though it helps
01:42:50.239 and of course if you want to keep
01:42:51.280 something secret you know that's out of
01:42:52.800 the question but you know putting that
01:42:54.080 aside just helping billions and billions
01:42:56.080 of dollars into it sure you're going to
01:42:57.440 make big strides and you get you know
01:42:59.199 real reasonable people to work on the
01:43:00.719 thing but you're still going to get
01:43:02.480 stuck
01:43:04.080 you know around the area where
01:43:05.780 [Music]
01:43:07.679 you don't have proper materials or you
01:43:09.920 know the techniques required
01:43:13.600 here to manufacture these things and
01:43:15.040 that's where you'll get stuck
01:43:18.159 if your patents are when you have to get
01:43:20.400 approved what do you plan on doing
01:43:22.800 at that point nothing just paying the
01:43:25.199 yearly fee to women
01:43:26.800 leave them alone
01:43:35.840 they really uh
01:43:39.920 didn't go into much it was they wanted
01:43:42.159 to tell you what we were doing out there
01:43:43.920 and they went into well
01:43:47.119 you know we reviewed this was secret
01:43:48.719 when we said it was secret you know we
01:43:50.560 didn't mean to bring your friends here
01:43:52.560 and you know things along those lines
01:43:54.000 they had flown in
01:43:56.480 uh
01:43:57.920 two of the guards that were on that
01:43:59.679 truck
01:44:00.960 uh that were watching us
01:44:03.199 and
01:44:04.400 it was my impression that they didn't
01:44:06.560 know what was behind the mountain what
01:44:08.960 we were watching they were just told to
01:44:10.560 guard what was going on i made it a
01:44:12.480 point in bringing up the uh you know
01:44:14.719 flying saucers and things of that sort
01:44:16.480 and
01:44:17.520 that's when they threatened me that's
01:44:19.199 when they mentioned the thing about my
01:44:20.560 wife
01:44:22.960 the way the reactor is operating that
01:44:24.639 the
01:44:27.199 you know the pulses that we detected out
01:44:29.040 of it were probably
01:44:31.840 you know instead of a straight dc power
01:44:33.600 supply it was a lot more along the lines
01:44:35.040 of a pulse as if uh you know we were
01:44:37.040 getting bursts of particles coming out
01:44:40.560 in any matter of mission and a reaction
01:44:42.480 a pulse of energy and that would repeat
01:44:44.159 that's around you know seven and a half
01:44:45.440 first something along those lines
01:45:00.560 well i mean gravity is
01:45:02.880 unfortunately the physics physics hasn't
01:45:05.119 gotten to that part yet but the gravity
01:45:06.800 essentially is part of the
01:45:07.679 electromagnetic spectrum
01:45:11.760 that's something i'm observing for
01:45:13.040 myself
01:45:16.000 about the microwave well you know you
01:45:17.760 can kind of sort of figure it out by the
01:45:19.679 dimensions of the uh
01:45:22.159 the waveguide itself and uh
01:45:38.560 but this is part of the equipment that
01:45:39.760 i'm working on and you know i want to
01:45:41.119 get it operating before uh
01:45:43.119 but we'll find out one day absolutely
01:45:46.880 did you ever get any idea through any
01:45:49.440 documentation or anything that this kind
01:45:51.600 of alien technology is being researched
01:45:53.600 or tested at any other planets
01:45:59.760 bob this information it asked for about
01:46:01.840 gravity propulsion and so on control
01:46:04.639 wave control
01:46:06.000 what does that do to
01:46:07.600 endeavors like kip thorne and caltech
01:46:09.199 with his ligo wanting to spend tens of
01:46:10.960 millions or
01:46:12.800 multiplied millions on
01:46:14.560 this light interferometry gravity
01:46:16.400 observatory i mean
01:46:17.840 doesn't it rather mothball that
01:46:20.320 it does and that's just another reason
01:46:21.840 for people not to
01:46:23.440 you know look at this
01:46:24.960 from a realistic point of view because
01:46:26.560 it really will shoot down a lot of
01:46:28.239 research effort like that exactly
01:46:30.880 you know it's it shouldn't
01:46:32.960 it shouldn't it's uh
01:46:35.360 research like that should go on anyway
01:46:37.119 if
01:46:38.080 if for nothing else just to prove that
01:46:39.520 it doesn't work
01:46:40.800 you know
01:46:41.450 [Laughter]
01:46:43.119 can i just go follow up i'm sorry um can
01:46:45.520 you speculate as to
01:46:47.280 how you think they found us
01:46:50.480 or why they came to us
01:46:52.400 i you can you can speculate as well as i
01:46:55.119 can i really can't uh
01:46:58.000 you know i mean would anything in their
01:46:59.920 in their technology seem to imply that
01:47:02.000 they can
01:47:02.960 sense life anywhere else or
01:47:05.920 uh it doesn't seem like just randomly
01:47:07.760 flying around the block
01:47:09.840 but if the documentation was correct
01:47:11.360 about genetic manipulation they didn't
01:47:13.199 have to find us
01:47:17.920 they didn't just happen to snoop around
01:47:19.679 roswell one day right
01:47:30.639 george knapp just got back from russia
01:47:32.400 and uh
01:47:34.000 i spoke with him recently and he
01:47:35.520 purchased
01:47:36.880 since apparently the whole country's up
01:47:38.800 for sale i guess he purchased from the
01:47:40.239 kgb and the russian government all
01:47:41.920 information pertaining to flying saucers
01:47:43.920 so
01:47:44.639 he's got that information
01:47:47.040 yeah i think they're
01:47:48.800 his company altamira corporation that
01:47:50.719 financed the whole trip and the whole
01:47:52.000 nine yards i guess he'll be releasing
01:47:53.440 that but he's got uh
01:47:54.960 all that stuff well
01:47:57.440 just a couple more i'm really feet
01:48:17.199 and around this area the fallout went up
01:48:19.440 to cedar city
01:48:21.520 how much according that epa monitor a
01:48:24.239 quarter of a mile away we're about four
01:48:26.400 times
01:48:27.679 the background dose that we've been
01:48:29.679 getting in los angeles
01:48:33.310 [Music]
01:48:40.000 plutonium though it doesn't you know all
01:48:42.239 go into fusion uh or fishing for that
01:48:44.560 matter it
01:48:45.200 [Music]
01:48:47.199 it's efficient hydrogen goes into fusion
01:48:49.600 uh is really consumed in the fireball
01:48:52.080 and you know the other fallout products
01:48:53.840 the radioactive iodine astronomy 90 and
01:48:56.080 things like that those are all over the
01:48:58.159 place and they're still around
01:49:00.560 but you know time has gone by though
01:49:02.400 most of them haven't even reached their
01:49:03.679 half-life yet but they are diluted in a
01:49:06.239 large amount of space and uh you know
01:49:08.719 it's relatively
01:49:10.560 safe the concentrations
01:49:12.960 went down aren't that
01:49:13.840 i broke and got chased out by the guards
01:49:16.000 and all the dust that got in the audible
01:49:18.080 oh that's no problem you know you die of
01:49:20.239 something else way before that
01:49:21.650 [Laughter]
01:49:23.360 so bob the cash land room saucer that
01:49:25.199 gave us off this tremendous radioactive
01:49:27.599 radiation
01:49:28.800 and causing these ladies irreparable
01:49:30.560 harm
01:49:31.520 how does that fit that's obviously not
01:49:32.960 element 115 gravity no it's not i think
01:49:35.760 that was i'm not even convinced that was
01:49:37.920 a you know alien craft that might have
01:49:39.840 been a government
01:49:41.440 attempt a nuclear-powered craft
01:49:43.520 incredibly dirty
01:49:45.440 obviously that uh and they you know
01:49:48.080 just looking at some of the you know
01:49:49.360 medical photographs the burns and their
01:49:51.440 you know the loss of hair
01:49:53.280 uh you know was either gamma or
01:49:54.639 neutrogen a neutron radiation and
01:49:58.159 i don't know what the status is well
01:49:59.760 that brings up another question our
01:50:01.040 friend jeff who actually saw the saucer
01:50:02.960 up close it shot out adam right at
01:50:04.239 mailbox
01:50:05.679 he saw it up close he said we showed
01:50:06.880 that earlier by the way anyway he said
01:50:08.639 that he got a a sort of a sunburn
01:50:10.560 probably from uv it's is it possible
01:50:12.159 these craft give off well beta burn is
01:50:14.080 also uh looks like sunburn uh you know
01:50:16.400 uh
01:50:17.199 yeah uh beta particles electrons it
01:50:19.840 looks exactly like sunburst so this
01:50:21.440 would be the radiation from the craft
01:50:22.960 and the excess uh yeah but you know if
01:50:25.280 you just we're going for a blood cell
01:50:26.639 test a uh you know a high white cell
01:50:29.040 count will
01:50:30.480 you know verify that it was radiation
01:50:32.000 exposure because you get that you know
01:50:34.320 reflex
01:50:36.960 i know it isn't your first choice to
01:50:38.400 make public appearances like this so i
01:50:40.000 just want to tell you in case nobody
01:50:41.840 else thinks it cool enough that we all
01:50:43.760 of us really appreciate you coming on
01:50:45.360 down
01:50:47.330 [Applause]
01:51:03.360 uh
01:51:07.830 [Applause]
01:51:17.380 [Music]
01:51:19.360 and is used to perpetuate the
01:51:21.119 conspiracy's vast wealth by the creation
01:51:24.159 of money out of nothing
01:51:26.800 two
01:51:27.920 in the united states this monetary fraud
01:51:30.719 is perpetuated through the federal
01:51:32.480 reserve system although the executive
01:51:35.199 branch theoretically has some control
01:51:37.520 over the system through occasional
01:51:39.040 appointments
01:51:40.159 in reality it is the system and those
01:51:42.800 behind it who control the executive
01:51:45.040 practice
01:51:46.880 three the capitalist conspiracy in this
01:51:50.320 country surfaces the public view in the
01:51:52.880 form of the semi-secret council on
01:51:55.360 foreign relations
01:51:57.360 its members exercise their control over
01:51:59.599 the nation through government
01:52:08.719 well as far as the alien bible i don't
01:52:10.480 know
01:52:11.280 what you're really talking about some of
01:52:12.719 the briefings that i read dealt with
01:52:14.880 some of that information about uh you
01:52:17.280 know as being the product of a genetic
01:52:19.760 modification right but
01:52:21.920 that's about all
01:52:24.000 that's about all that i know
01:52:25.360 repercussions the big story all that
01:52:27.760 and all that i really have an idea about
01:52:29.520 well i meant like uh you mentioned the
01:52:31.440 date when they were supposed to return
01:52:32.960 is something supposed to happen when
01:52:34.239 they return
01:52:36.000 i have no idea it was just a date
01:52:38.719 and uh it was it was a number that made
01:52:40.880 no sense to me it was a
01:52:42.960 601 or 300 something obviously in a
01:52:46.000 different numerical system
01:52:48.560 and so other than having created us and
01:52:50.880 done the genetic upgrades because that's
01:52:53.040 it as far as
01:52:54.239 supposedly if that information is
01:52:55.760 correct
01:53:00.880 i'm interested a little bit more about
01:53:02.320 the physics of the power generation
01:53:05.679 from the development of the antimatter
01:53:08.800 to
01:53:09.100 [Music]
01:53:10.320 to the gravity a wave and amplification
01:53:13.440 and that process
01:53:15.040 of the generation of that
01:53:17.679 and being able to follow space
01:53:23.119 that's a pretty lengthy explanation
01:53:25.440 um in other words the relationship
01:53:27.040 between the development of the
01:53:27.920 antimatter and the gravitational force
01:53:30.159 field
01:53:33.440 well it's i can
01:53:35.360 give you i guess a brief overview of
01:53:38.000 essentially how that works if you want
01:53:39.679 an in-depth
01:53:41.280 description of that you can give me your
01:53:43.040 address and i can send you a paper on it
01:53:46.719 essentially what the reactor does
01:53:49.760 is
01:53:52.639 provide electrical power and the base
01:53:54.560 gravity wave to amplify and it does that
01:53:57.599 by
01:53:58.560 interacting matter and antimatter
01:54:00.400 essentially
01:54:01.920 the way it does that is
01:54:04.560 injecting an accelerated proton into a
01:54:07.440 piece of 115 that spontaneously
01:54:09.760 generates
01:54:11.360 any hydrogen essentially
01:54:13.679 that's reacted
01:54:15.280 in a
01:54:18.400 a small area it's a compressed gas
01:54:20.800 probably compressed atmospheric gas
01:54:23.119 and uh
01:54:24.320 you know the antimatter reacting with
01:54:26.560 matter produces the energy
01:54:29.360 mainly heat energy and that is converted
01:54:31.119 to electrical energy by a thermionic
01:54:33.040 generator that appears to be 100
01:54:35.360 efficient
01:54:37.440 which is you know a difficult concept
01:54:40.159 to believe anyway uh also the reactor
01:54:43.040 has two functions that's one of them the
01:54:44.560 other function is
01:54:46.560 it provides the basic
01:54:48.320 gravity wave that's amplified and that
01:54:50.800 appears at the upper sphere
01:54:53.199 of the amplifier itself and that's
01:54:54.880 tapped off with a waveguide similar to
01:54:56.639 microwaves and uh is amplified
01:55:01.920 and focused essentially so how is the
01:55:04.400 electrical energy related to the
01:55:05.760 amplification of the gravitational a
01:55:07.599 weight
01:55:09.280 they're probably about uh four inches
01:55:11.520 thick anyway so you really can't tell
01:55:12.960 how thin
01:55:14.239 the uh the skin is itself or if it's
01:55:16.840 exotic that's right
01:55:19.520 yes more on this element 115 and your
01:55:22.639 contention that it couldn't be made here
01:55:24.560 on earth
01:55:26.880 what if we found the right bombardment
01:55:29.360 of speed the right target shape and the
01:55:31.520 right containment
01:55:33.760 well i imagine with enough time you can
01:55:36.480 make a small amount of it i mean
01:55:38.880 my analogy is look at uh
01:55:41.599 look at how long it takes to make gold
01:55:42.960 an accelerator from bismuth or something
01:55:44.719 like that that may just be a technology
01:55:47.679 that hasn't advanced far enough yet
01:55:51.440 right but the bottom line is you have to
01:55:54.159 sit there and plug in
01:55:57.040 protons
01:55:58.639 and neutrons for that matter into an
01:56:00.400 existing atom and you have to do it you
01:56:02.480 know essentially on an individual basis
01:56:04.480 and they're not all going to catch on
01:56:05.840 and so we're going to
01:56:07.440 but how did how do you think they got
01:56:09.599 their first piece
01:56:11.040 if it was in a
01:56:12.320 dead star how uh going from i think it
01:56:15.199 was naturally occurring somewhere on
01:56:16.880 their planet just because it's stable
01:56:18.480 yeah probably some
01:56:21.199 that's just a guess on my part but uh
01:56:25.199 you know if that technology was
01:56:26.560 harnessed quick enough chances are they
01:56:29.119 didn't have uh you know when they came
01:56:31.280 here our levels of technology were
01:56:33.360 probably fairly new to them they've
01:56:34.719 probably never been considered an
01:56:35.920 internal combustion engineer for that
01:56:37.520 matter
01:56:38.639 you know when they came flying into the
01:56:40.239 atmosphere i saw little cigar shaped
01:56:42.000 things with fire coming out the back
01:56:43.360 they probably couldn't conceive of how
01:56:44.719 they were powered so it was uh
01:56:46.960 you know
01:56:48.239 it just all depends how you know what
01:56:50.880 materials raw materials you have
01:56:53.679 but you know that's just an opinion that
01:56:55.199 that was a natural agreement
01:57:02.000 as of the time that i was there i was
01:57:03.679 told that they didn't they really didn't
01:57:05.599 take them any great distance at all
01:57:07.119 other than right outside uh
01:57:15.760 if we had a working agreement with the
01:57:17.360 aliens at one time
01:57:19.119 um
01:57:20.080 why didn't they give us a user's manual
01:57:22.000 for these ships
01:57:31.270 [Music]
01:57:33.119 it almost seems like there has been some
01:57:34.880 assistance or some information found but
01:57:38.480 but who knows your information didn't
01:57:40.159 indicate that now
01:57:42.719 yeah uh with such tight security around
01:57:45.119 there's supposedly only 500 pounds of
01:57:48.000 this material how is it somebody can get
01:57:50.560 some of it out of it
01:57:52.400 because some of them not some of the
01:57:54.000 material the material is
01:57:56.000 that they have there is essentially raw
01:57:59.280 the material is
01:58:00.880 it has to be machined into discs these
01:58:03.520 discs have to be stacked up and then cut
01:58:05.440 into a cone shape and then sliced
01:58:08.690 [Music]
01:58:10.000 along the long axis of it that work is
01:58:12.480 done at los alamos
01:58:15.199 i don't i'm not exactly sure no loss
01:58:16.639 almost
01:58:17.520 the electrical energy is
01:58:20.560 essentially without wires and i related
01:58:22.639 it to almost a tesla setup it seemed
01:58:24.960 like each sub-component on the craft was
01:58:27.199 attuned
01:58:28.400 to the frequency that the reactor was
01:58:30.400 operating at so essentially the
01:58:32.480 amplifiers themselves receive the
01:58:34.560 electrical energy like a tesla coil
01:58:36.719 transmits power to
01:58:38.560 a fluorescent tube
01:58:41.679 and
01:58:43.679 what was the rest of the question
01:58:46.000 yeah in other words what is the
01:58:47.280 relationship between i think that's you
01:58:48.960 basically answered yeah that's that's
01:58:50.960 how the amplifiers receive the power
01:58:52.480 through the waveguide to receive the
01:58:53.840 basic wave it's almost it's very very
01:58:56.320 similar to a microwave amplifier
01:58:58.480 and uh you know for more technical
01:59:00.480 description and i can send you drawings
01:59:02.480 or things along those lines but
01:59:04.560 that's basically how it works
01:59:07.520 i understand you took some
01:59:09.119 115 home with you
01:59:10.880 to uh do some testing on your own i
01:59:13.599 obtained it yeah
01:59:16.000 document any of your testing yeah you
01:59:18.239 did
01:59:19.599 yeah the video mostly video tape and
01:59:21.360 things like that john said it was stolen
01:59:23.280 from you later last night he said they
01:59:25.360 stole it back
01:59:26.400 he said
01:59:27.760 well there's another level to that but
01:59:29.920 like i said right now it's in private
01:59:31.599 hands okay
01:59:35.599 element 115 um
01:59:38.400 john said last night that a piece a
01:59:40.159 wedge that's about two inches in length
01:59:42.719 run
01:59:49.440 well it really depends on the energy
01:59:50.880 level the more energy you expend
01:59:53.760 the uh you know greater consumption of
01:59:55.360 fuel just like in any any modern machine
01:59:57.679 so
01:59:58.800 it really really all depends on the
02:00:00.639 amount of energy you requested
02:00:04.639 what is dr keller's relationship to ask
02:00:07.040 for do you think he might be working on
02:00:09.040 antimatter weaponry
02:00:12.080 i don't know but he was certainly uh
02:00:15.760 i forgot what his exact title was he was
02:00:18.000 chief consultant or something along
02:00:19.599 those lines
02:00:21.119 and as far as any amount of weaponry i
02:00:23.119 don't i don't think anyone was involved
02:00:24.960 in that certainly some uh
02:00:27.360 beam weapon work and uh you know teller
02:00:29.440 has been involved with that uh
02:00:31.920 i think his last project that
02:00:33.920 livermore los alamos was um
02:00:36.719 i think he called it super excalibur and
02:00:38.560 that was essentially a uh
02:00:40.639 nuclear bomb detonated in orbit and
02:00:42.880 fiber optic light guides that directed
02:00:44.880 x-rays to uh incoming warheads and
02:00:48.239 that's his pet project he loves that
02:00:50.239 thing so i don't think he'd jump to
02:00:52.719 any
02:01:05.520 i don't know if anything was on level
02:01:07.280 well i don't know if there were any
02:01:08.320 bathrooms on level three i can only
02:01:10.239 guess and i would imagine that there was
02:01:12.719 some sort of navigational equipment or
02:01:14.480 their version of a computer or something
02:01:16.080 along those lines because i saw nothing
02:01:17.920 else that
02:01:19.679 controlled
02:01:20.880 the uh the amplifiers the directions
02:01:22.960 they pointed at
02:01:24.880 knows what they're doing uh apparently
02:01:27.199 they think that they're developing
02:01:29.199 uh the little coins they're working on
02:01:31.280 is some new type of armor
02:01:33.199 and uh having worked in los alamos and
02:01:35.679 no people
02:01:36.800 around that area that's i obtained some
02:01:39.119 of it
02:01:41.760 can you say anything about project
02:01:44.800 looking glass and the relationship
02:01:46.400 between gravity and time
02:01:48.800 well gravity and time are almost
02:01:50.239 essentially the same thing
02:01:52.560 and looking glass dealt with using
02:01:54.560 gravity essentially to distort time and
02:01:58.000 as i've said before i really know very
02:01:59.599 little about that but you know they're
02:02:00.960 only talking talking about milliseconds
02:02:03.040 or even less microseconds of
02:02:05.599 time distortion they're not like looking
02:02:07.520 back in time to see who killed kennedy
02:02:09.599 or something
02:02:14.560 the
02:02:15.280 crap that you are you talking about the
02:02:16.880 scout craft is that the one that's
02:02:18.320 likely a damn ski picture with the three
02:02:20.800 domes underneath and if it's not i'm not
02:02:23.440 exactly sure what the dams
02:02:25.199 is the saucer shape this is this is the
02:02:27.760 one that uh
02:02:29.520 looks like a my one of the mirecraft
02:02:33.599 did you see
02:02:34.960 any others than that one or is there
02:02:37.199 nine up there yeah i saw nine total but
02:02:39.199 that's the only one i got close enough
02:02:40.719 to did you see one of the three domes
02:02:42.639 underneath that
02:02:44.320 three balls underneath that has the
02:02:45.760 central housing underneath and then the
02:02:47.840 second question was um did anybody give
02:02:50.639 you any indication as to who was driving
02:02:52.800 or any information on that
02:02:56.000 i assumed that it was humans that were
02:02:58.080 violating the craft so it could have
02:03:00.239 been remote control but at the one test
02:03:02.000 flight that i saw on the ground uh
02:03:04.560 they were in radio communication with
02:03:06.159 someone and i assumed it was someone in
02:03:08.080 the craft
02:03:09.679 i mentioned it's possible that it could
02:03:11.119 have been a remote observer somewhere
02:03:12.639 but uh and i just assumed that the seats
02:03:15.280 were retrofitted or they were sitting on
02:03:17.280 the floor for that matter
02:03:21.360 uh are you familiar with a couple
02:03:24.400 aspects of the question are you familiar
02:03:26.080 with howard manger's electrocraft
02:03:28.480 and
02:03:29.280 otis cars
02:03:30.960 saucer design and how are those
02:03:33.280 how are their devices
02:03:35.440 how do they generate their gravity
02:03:37.040 fields
02:03:38.080 and compared with what you've described
02:03:40.320 and lastly uh can you
02:03:43.119 can you speculate how the
02:03:45.840 why the commercialization of some of
02:03:47.520 these crafts hasn't been possible with
02:03:49.440 so many different uh patents applied for
02:03:52.800 these kinds of design
02:03:54.719 because they don't work
02:03:59.040 are there any g-forces encountered by
02:04:01.440 the products inside the crack
02:04:05.679 from your interviews you seem to feel
02:04:07.520 that the
02:04:08.880 area 51 or the escort test site was kind
02:04:12.000 of slip shot and how it how it does its
02:04:14.960 research it really doesn't have the
02:04:17.199 facilities there to actually do the
02:04:18.800 research correctly and also i wonder
02:04:21.199 could you comment about that and also
02:04:22.560 i'm wondering what you could tell us
02:04:24.000 about the other types of ships you saw
02:04:25.920 there that you thought were alien in
02:04:27.679 origin
02:04:30.480 well the uh as far as the research of
02:04:32.719 that
02:04:34.079 bob how do you perceive that mankind can
02:04:35.760 develop this
02:04:41.040 uh i really don't
02:04:44.239 i really don't without access to certain
02:04:45.920 materials
02:04:47.440 or maybe new manufacturing techniques
02:04:49.280 that can produce those but until those
02:04:51.360 problems are solved you know the fact
02:04:53.199 that we even know how to how to deal
02:04:54.639 with it or even duplicate it uh
02:04:58.079 you know it's pretty useless
02:05:00.000 how many other materials might be
02:05:01.599 necessary uh besides 115 that you know
02:05:08.320 the rest of it might be just
02:05:09.870 [Music]
02:05:11.360 essentially
02:05:12.719 polishing up manufacturing techniques
02:05:14.719 making things smaller you know just
02:05:16.239 general increase in technology getting a
02:05:19.040 small accelerator running at a
02:05:21.199 higher energy level
02:05:23.040 i don't know about the
02:05:24.480 the metallurgy aspect of the craft i
02:05:26.320 don't think any exotic metals are
02:05:27.760 necessary though they may be employed
02:05:31.199 i don't i imagine you could make a craft
02:05:33.520 out of aluminum if necessary
02:05:35.840 but uh what part that plays i i don't
02:05:38.400 know
02:05:40.239 is there any significance to the saucer
02:05:42.880 shape the geometry having to do with any
02:05:44.719 resonance or anything of that nature not
02:05:46.719 any resonance but it's important most of
02:05:48.320 the edges on the craft around it because
02:05:49.920 a high voltage field does appear at most
02:05:52.560 of the craft except for the upper
02:05:54.800 the last upper bump there's a little
02:05:56.400 ring before that now i'm only talking
02:05:57.840 about one craft so i don't know about
02:05:59.280 the rest but there's a small ring before
02:06:01.840 that a darker black one and that's an
02:06:03.440 insulator ring and that's the only place
02:06:05.599 above that that upper section the third
02:06:07.679 level is where high voltage does not
02:06:09.679 appear
02:06:12.320 did any technology that came from the
02:06:14.239 aliens resemble anything that we can do
02:06:16.000 today
02:06:17.520 but we advance to any degree that
02:06:20.560 they are
02:06:22.800 well there are some basic
02:06:25.119 things
02:06:25.690 [Music]
02:06:27.119 the fact that they are using a little
02:06:28.400 accelerator with smaller you know we
02:06:30.159 have things like that if that's what
02:06:31.679 you're getting at
02:06:34.480 anything really advanced
02:06:37.040 uh
02:06:38.000 well as far as controlling gravity waves
02:06:41.199 yeah other than the fact that just the
02:06:42.719 way the craft operates
02:06:45.119 you know by manipulating gravity that's
02:06:48.079 that's about it really
02:06:51.760 well i wanted to ask you
02:06:53.679 talking about metal version
02:06:55.840 what you observed in terms of
02:06:59.040 the structure the skin of it thickness
02:07:01.280 because you know there were reports from
02:07:03.119 roswell
02:07:04.320 other where that there was a very thin
02:07:07.040 type of metal skin that was really
02:07:09.239 undamageable and so on
02:07:14.079 well i called it metal and uh i really
02:07:17.119 can't say that's what it was i called it
02:07:19.040 metal because i slid my hand across it
02:07:21.760 and it was cold and it was semi you know
02:07:24.159 lustrous so did you notice any place
02:07:26.000 like where you know on an edge or
02:07:27.040 something where it may have been a lot
02:07:28.560 thinner than your standard metal or
02:07:31.199 balloon
02:07:32.000 aircraft it's hard from the outside you
02:07:33.760 can't tell when you walk in the way the
02:07:38.400 the way the archways are inside
