00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,920

00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:40,470
Welcome to Art Bell, Somewhere in Time, the night featuring Coast to Coast AM from September 26th, 1997 from the High desert at the Great American Southwest. I bid you all good evening or good morning as the case may be across all these many prolific time zones

3
00:00:40,870 --> 00:01:00,710
stretching from the Hawaiian and Asian island chains in the West, eastward to the Caribbean and the US Virgin Islands and much more of the Caribbean S into South America, north all the way to the pole and worldwide on the Internet. This is Coast to Coast AM Good morning. You are about to experience

4
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,870
history in the making this morning in more ways than one.

5
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:14,510
Coming up in a few moments, Bob Lazar and Gene Huff. Bob Lazar, I'll tell you all about as well as Gene in a moment in detail, but

6
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:24,590
suffice to say Bob is probably one of the best known people in all of Ufology

7
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:36,430
and has not done many interviews over the years, has kind of shunned them over the years. I interviewed him many years ago, four or five in fact, so many that he doesn't even remember.

8
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:49,000
That was back when our present just about 400 radio stations were instead 1. So I can assure you, you have quite a treat coming up

9
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,150
this morning.

10
00:01:52,590 --> 00:02:05,670
Now I would like to welcome KNST, That's KNST AM in Tucson, AZ Boy, are we ever glad to be on board. Full time now in Tucson. 790 in Tucson.

11
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,120
And such will be the case. They'll also carry Dreamland on Sunday.

12
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,320
Now, one other little item. This is going to be the weekend to get filthy rich on the Rogue Market.

13
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:39,310
The Rogue Market? What is that? Well, it is a strange kind of place and a lot of fun. It's more fun than you had in a long time. And this weekend is going to be the capper. This weekend my stock price is going to go over 12,000.

14
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:54,510
You watch and see and if you get in early and you are part of all this early, you will make many Rogue Dollars. You will then be able to convert those Rogue Dollars into Rogue Prizes,

15
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,480
coffee mugs, that sort of thing.

16
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,540
It's just like the real stock market, except that

17
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,710
it's not real money.

18
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:15,190
It really is a lot of fun, folks. Anyway, coming up in a moment, Bob Lazar and Gene Huff.

19
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:41,830
One more quick item and then I think we're underway, and this comes from The Associated Press. Are you ready?

20
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:53,760
An unidentified wingless object traveling at high speed past dangerously close to a Swiss Air jetliner? A 747? A Boeing 747

21
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:18,970
of flying between Philadelphia and Boston, according to the airline. On Friday, the pilot and copilot gave US investigators different descriptions of the object that passed about get this folks 50 yards from the Boeing 747 after it had taken off from Philadelphia on August 9th. The pilot told the US National Transportation Safety Boy that the object

22
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,080
was a long and wingless copilot, said it was more spherical.

23
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:34,540
The incident took place at 23,000 feet. The planes final destination was Zurich, Switzerland

24
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:45,840
that is from The Associated Press. So it looks like a 747 just had a close encounter with something.

25
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,030
All right, here we go. Bob Lazar

26
00:04:49,670 --> 00:05:13,430
is the ex government scientist who in 1989 came forward with the fact that he had been part of a team of scientists who back engineered extraterrestrial disks, flying saucers, in other words, at a base known as S4 some 15 miles South of the infamous Area 51 at Groom Lake.

27
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:22,350
Bob's story is the main reason behind the State of Nevada changing the name of Nevada State Highway 375,

28
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,950
the highway to Area 51 or S4

29
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,830
to its new name, the Extra Terrestrial Highway

30
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:42,150
Deed. Bob currently runs a company that manufacturers and repairs Alpha Radiation detectors. He also creates

31
00:05:43,840 --> 00:06:02,000
CGI computer generated graphics and simulations for technical and legal demonstration videos, for which he uses his mainframe supercomputer, which by the way, is the second fastest computer in the state of Nevada, second only to the one at Nellis Air Force Base.

32
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,190
Bob also has a small photo processing lab in his home.

33
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,790
In his spare time, Bob does pyrotechnical and rocket research

34
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,990
and throws Desert Blast, his annual fireworks blowout at the Nevada desert.

35
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:27,070
And if memory serves, he also fools around with alternative fuels for cars.

36
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:37,630
He comes this morning with Jeanne Huff, Bob's longtime friend and business partner who is the writer and Co producer of the Lazar tape.

37
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:57,190
Gene is a real estate appraiser and screenwriter. His screenplay As for the Bob Lazar Story has recently been optioned and was chosen over three other screenplays on the Lazar story written by writers Jim Cresson. I guess that's right. Croissant or Cresson,

38
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:04,870
who wrote The Morning After with Jeff Bridges and Jane Fonda. Roy Carlson who wrote China Moon

39
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:31,830
with Edna Harris and Madeleine Stowe and David Robbett. I guess it would be Rob, a rabbi who wrote Casualties of War with Sean Penn and Michael J Fox and Co wrote the firm with Tom Cruise and Gene Hackman. So this is quite a coup obviously for an entry level screenwriter. But then again, Gene has had the inside track.

40
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,840
Good morning. Bob, are you there?

41
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:52,310
I'm here. And Gene, are you there? Yes, Sir. I welcome to you both. Thank you. Bob, is it really true it had to have been 40, maybe five years ago that I interviewed you in concert with John Lear?

42
00:07:52,750 --> 00:08:22,150
Yeah, I honestly don't remember that. My friends tell me I have about the worst memory that can be had. But from what I recall years ago, I remember John Lear apparently booking me on your show and never telling me about it. I remember that, but I don't. And then I really don't remember ever doing the show. No. There was a time, maybe even a couple of years before that when we had you on. For sure. A while. All right. I think he called in.

43
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:34,760
That was it. That was it called in when Lear was on the show? That's what it was, Yes. Yes. Well, I don't even remember that, but I'll take everyone's word for it. All right. Well, in fact, we now have such a gigantic audience out there

44
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:51,990
that hardly anybody knows who you are, Bob, except for, of course, you know, you ufologists and so forth, who would be very familiar with your story. So the great majority of the audience, 99%, have no idea who Bob Lazar is.

45
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,750
Now. I guess that means we have to begin at the beginning

46
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,550
with regard to

47
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,550
how you. Well, first of all, Bob, you're a physicist, correct?

48
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,030
Or was at the time. Was at the time, yeah.

49
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:22,590
Umm, how did you become involved with or begin to get involved with whatever it is out there at Area 51 or is specifically S4?

50
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,030
Well, let me try and give you the Reader's Digest version.

51
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,760
Some years ago I was working at Los Alamos National Labs in New Mexico.

52
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,920
One particular day

53
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:52,400
I was going down to the lecture hall to hear Edward Teller speak, who as most people know as the father of the hydrogen bomb. Yes, I got down there a little early because I wanted to get in,

54
00:09:53,070 --> 00:10:06,750
assuming there is going to be a crowd of people, and actually, to my surprise, there's hardly anyone there. Coincidentally, that day the local newspaper in town, the Monitor, had printed a front page article on me,

55
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,270
and

56
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:19,710
right outside the lecture hall was Doctor Teller, reading the front page of the paper. So I thought it was a perfect opportunity to introduce myself and just say hi. Absolutely,

57
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,870
It was just a casual meeting and

58
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:43,350
the only reason I bring it up is years later I had moved out of Los Alamos after I quit working for the lab. I opened up my own business that did some contract work for the lab and also started off one hour Photoshop for my wife that she ran there.

59
00:10:44,110 --> 00:11:01,950
We later moved out of Los Alamos to Las Vegas and again sometime later I decided, you know, I had missed working in the scientific community. So I decided to get back in and send out resumes. I sent them out really all over the place to the places where I

60
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,070
essentially like to live a little more.

61
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:17,070
I really don't remember where else, but one of the other resumes I sent was to Doctor Teller's attention and I had referenced our meeting back then.

62
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:41,840
A short time later I got a call from him and he did Remember Me to my surprise and said we might have a position you're interested in. I said great. I went down and was interviewed. At that time there were a couple EG and G buildings by Mccarran Airport out here. I recall Las Vegas.

63
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:51,840
I really don't know what's there now. Someone tells me there's still one building, but there used to be two before they expanded the airport. One of special projects and I don't know what the other one was, but in either case

64
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,390
I was told to go down there for an interview. The interview was relatively short

65
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,390
and I really don't remember

66
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:07,950
specifically what the job entailed, but they told me I was basically overqualified and would become bored with it in a short time.

67
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:18,510
I said fine, but they said we might have something else in the future for you. I said fine, OK, and basically went back home figuring they had blown you off.

68
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:35,520
I really don't remember what the job was, but it didn't really even sound too exciting to me. So it really didn't, you know, really didn't ring my bell. You recall anything about a technician level or something that would have been boring? I really don't, you know, remember this

69
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:51,110
when I, when I go through most of the stuff, people are amazed. You know, boy, how come you can't remember these facts? You know, this is a, you know, fantastic point in your life. And yeah, yeah. But you know, it's also a decade old now and it's better to remember specifics here and there. However,

70
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,350
as it turned out, they did call back and had another position.

71
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,480
The position was stated to be something that was involving

72
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,830
a field propulsion system,

73
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:30,830
which to me in my mind sounded something along the lines of some electromagnetic propulsion, something that might be used in space, maybe, I don't know, an ion drive system using mercury vapor, something like that. Or you, you've always, you've always been fascinated by propulsion system. Anything, anything with, you know, exerts tremendous amount of energy from, you know, explosives to,

74
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,200
you know,

75
00:13:33,390 --> 00:14:03,270
high energy weapons, anything along those lines, propulsion. And they, umm. And coincidentally, the article that Doctor Teller was reading was about a car that I had converted to run on a jet engine. Now, you see, I remember that. And then you, you converted another one, I believe to run on hydrogen, didn't you? Yeah. Actually, I'm really surprised that you remember that. I don't remember. That is one of the number one things I get asked about. I know I have a good memory bug

76
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,470
for some of that, but in either case, I, I

77
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,990
after more or less lengthy interview, I

78
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,600
except the job and of course I had to go back a second time.

79
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:46,550
Can you remember any of the details of this rather lengthy interview? I mean, was a lot of IT security or security oriented? Well, there were certainly a lot of security, security oriented questions and so forth later on. However, keep in mind that I had just come from Los Alamos just a few or a couple years before where I had cue clearance, civilian, you know, top secret clearance.

80
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,120
So, and they really didn't have to go and dig deep

81
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:57,470
back into my past to see if I was, you know, of Russian descent or anything along those lines. So

82
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:23,950
basically the job just seemed like a, you know, typical research and development job. I was anxious to get started on it and things went on. They all they told me is that it was in a remote area out in the desert and that I would initially I would fly out there maybe once, possibly twice a week just to kind of get caught up on stuff. And they had to

83
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,160
reinstate my clearance, which would take, you know, perhaps a couple weeks,

84
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:43,750
maybe a month at the latest. Sure. And so in the mean time, I was given busy, essentially busy work to do, or at least that's how it rang in my mind. And this is typical too at Los Alamos, you know, if

85
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:59,190
you're initially hired there before your clearance goes through, sometimes, you know, obtaining 2 clearance can take up to 13 months. So they don't just have you sit at home, you know, before you go to work for the lab, sit around and work on alarm systems or something like that. Doesn't

86
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:12,400
usually below your potential, but something to keep you busy. That rings true. I was in the Air Force. They did that to us all the time. Yeah, it's it's pretty. It's pretty common. So I thought, well, this, you know, very typical.

87
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:19,470
I had no idea what this would actually entail until I got into it. And obviously they

88
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:33,430
looking through their eyes, I guess it made sense that they couldn't, they couldn't, of course, divulge what this job had would actually entail before they had, you know, gone through all the security,

89
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:46,390
uh, and whatnot. But, umm, you know, that's essentially how the job came about. All right. One thing that I would think you would remember is your impressions of Mr. Teller.

90
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:56,000
I do. As far as what? Well, what kind of guy was he? You know, just simple questions. What kind of guy was he? He was.

91
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,950
Umm. He seems to have two faces, you know, which is strange in talking to him

92
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,280
one-on-one. He's a very polite, pleasant, intelligent man.

93
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:27,150
However, virtually any interview you'll see of this guy, he comes across as the most pompous, mean person you have ever run into in your life.

94
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:43,560
I don't know how else to describe him, but he was not nearly as short, not physically speaking. But I mean, you know, if you see him in interviews, you'll see him answer questions specifically to the point,

95
00:17:44,070 --> 00:18:01,110
short and on to the next question and not be very talkative, not offer any information, you know, other than what you're immediately talking about. And, and in person, he was certainly not that way. So is, you know, the exact opposite. Very pleasant and willing to talk about anything.

96
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:15,520
Nuclear weapons or anything. Oh, well, that's what I was going to ask about last night. I interviewed Professor Michio Kaku. Never heard of it. A very preeminent physicist back at New York University,

97
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:46,830
and he, too, has worked with Professor Teller. And I asked Professor Kaku why he had not participated in the hydrogen bomb development, and he said he simply chose not to. He wanted to go into a different direction with physics and had quite a bit to say about Edward Teller. And apparently he was consumed during the Cold War years with national security, you know, with the being

98
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:54,590
about national security. And this is Doctor Teller. Yes. Uh-huh. And developing bombs. And in fact, even today

99
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:20,160
the programs go on, I guess, with the third generation of hydrogen bombs, sort of designer bombs. Professor Kaku said, Anyway, that's why I asked you about Edward Teller. Listen, everybody, hold tight. We're at the bottom of the hour and we'll be right back. Bob Lazar and Gene Huff are my guests. And the story that you're about to hear unfold

100
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:35,270
will curl your hair. I'm Art Bell. This is coast to coast AM. You're listening to Art Bell Somewhere in Time on Premiere Radio Network tonight at encore presentation of Costa Costello from September 26th, 1997.

101
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,120


102
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:59,320


103
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:19,480


104
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:39,680


105
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,840


106
00:20:44,840 --> 00:21:05,000


107
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:20,070
Bells Somewhere in Time, the night featuring a replay of Coast to Coast AM from September 26th, 1997. My guests are Bob Lazar, a long-awaited interview along with Gene Huff, and we'll get back to them in a moment.

108
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:50,830
Now back to Bob Lazar and Gene Huff. Gentlemen, you're back on the air again. All right, Bob, So you, you've got the job. You landed the job and they had you doing busy work

109
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,640
and then busy work hadn't started.

110
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,230
That's what I thought was going to happen instead,

111
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:04,110
Umm, where did we leave off? Umm,

112
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:25,330
well, actually with busy work, they were kind of, well, that's, you know, he had anticipated busy work, but now you had to go to work the first day. Yeah, essentially. I I guess essentially it was to get caught up with what was going on. And really, to my surprise, the security was a little more than oppressive.

113
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,080
You know, generally you're just assigned a badge and shown the general procedures and and things of that sort.

114
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,600
This was a little different.

115
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:50,270
Are you still talking about the facility near Las Vegas or are you talking about being flown up there? No, this is when finally I was flown. So I go to Mccarran Airport, right by the

116
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,800
flown to Groom Lake.

117
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:05,370
Umm, as I landed there the first time, right across from where the plane parked, UMM, there's a security officer was a security office.

118
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:27,080
Umm, and that's I, I believe I spent quite a while there, but you know, reviewing, you know, how secure things are so on and so forth. But umm, you know, this is not where I worked. Where I did work was about, from my estimates, about 10 or 15 miles South of there. We were taken there in a

119
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:59,470
converted school bus, you know, those big Bluebird jobs that was painted kind of a dark Navy blue. There's a lot of people bombed who don't even believe that Area 51 exists, by the way, much less S4. I live out here in Pahrump, I think. I mean people, I can tell you don't believe Area 51 exists. Well, there are lot of people don't, but I can tell you, Bob, when when you drive up by the VFW here in Prompt at about 4:30 or five in the morning, there's a whole bunch of buses out there and they've got signs right on the side

120
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:05,310
buses. I saw it about a month ago and it just says Area 51. Oh, really? Yeah, Yeah.

121
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,080
Not bothering anymore to keep that secret I guess.

122
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:33,550
Anyway, so then they take you in some from from Groom, like the main facility and incidentally Bob up on my website. I've got a picture, a pretty good one, the best one I've ever seen of the Groom Lake facility, and it shows what appeared to be 3 large hangers, with the one in the center perhaps being the largest. Is that your recollection?

123
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:45,860
Three large hangers? Yeah, three big hangers. There are a lot of other attendant buildings, but three rather large hangars.

124
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:57,850
I don't recall there being three, you know, obviously large hangers on the on the approach in from Las Vegas, You know, that that stood out that much above everything else.

125
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:11,400
I recall a huge satellite dish. But for the most part, most of the time I was going there at night and certainly didn't have a run of the place. All I did was get to go in one time. I got to go to the cafeteria,

126
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,640
but other than that, it was merely a stop

127
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:24,710
toward S4. Yeah, toward S4. But, you know, I don't really recall there being three large

128
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:50,670
hangers really that stood out more than anything else. Did you ever see anything unusual at all at Groom? Like the thing I did see that was unusual was some sort of advanced rocket or jet plane. People have called it Aurora. I don't, I don't, I don't know if it was Aurora or or if even, or if it even exists, but

129
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,320
John Andrews from the Tester Corporation

130
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:14,510
and a few other aviation buffs kind of interviewed me more or less about that. It was something along the lines of an X15 shaped type of craft. Now we were driving away from this as it was taxing, but it was a, a horrendously loud

131
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:47,470
uh, tearing sound that the engines made. And I think my original description was that it made it sound like the air was tearing and that's the, the best description I could give to it. Now, I certainly have heard about the new generation of, of scramjet engines that have supersonic air flow inside that burn liquid methane and so on and so forth. Whether that was these I don't know, but I did get a look up the exhaust as we were turning and it was they were Rectang

132
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,550
off with some sort of veins inside.

133
00:26:51,240 --> 00:27:00,440
That's all the information I can give, and what it was I don't know, but that was the strangest thing I ever saw. Do you recall the general shape of the aircraft? Was it close to what we would call lifting body?

134
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:11,240
Even though the X15 was a lifting body, it was not a lifting body like you'd see on an F16 or something, where there'd be a, you know, a lot more,

135
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:26,390
a lot more wing incorporated into the body. It was more along the lines of a long, slender body. Maybe the cross between an F104 and an X15 for those people that are familiar with those planes. Very short, stubby wings,

136
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:37,800
you know, which translates to me, you know, you know, high speed of rotation, high flight speed and things like that. But you know, again, I didn't get

137
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,270
a very good look at it and I don't know what it could have been,

138
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,790
anything else, scientific research vehicle or anything. I'm certainly not claiming that was Aurora,

139
00:27:50,640 --> 00:28:18,520
but sometime later some of those people were down in Rachel and they heard and recorded a sound that they interpreted as the sky tearing and played it back to me and it was in fact the identical sound. So a couple of years later it was still operational, whatever that thing was, but that was the only unusual thing I ever saw there. All right, so you landed and they generally then you I guess get off the tarmac there and get right on a bus.

140
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:33,870
Yeah well, straight across from where the plane parked head and straight across from there in kind of a large parking area was the security building. And that's where we picked up the bus and went S the first time we, I did go in and it was an extensive

141
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:44,000
little get together with the security people there and signed all kinds of strange forms that were there a lot of people on the bus.

142
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:52,390
No, not going down to ask for generally the person that accompanied me all the time was Dennis Mariani, who was my supervisor at that time.

143
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:04,640
So then they had you sign all kinds of forms. What kind of forms? Well, everything from signing virtually, signing away my constitutional rights. So should anything go wrong as far as me

144
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,310
pulling my guts, rolling your guts, yeah, they would,

145
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:14,750
you know, essentially be judge, jury and executioner.

146
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,790
Umm, as far as the authorization

147
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,800
to attain the clearance there, that was an order that was signed by President Reagan, which I saw on the desk.

148
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,920
I'm trying to remember some of the other paperwork beforehand. I gave permission to have my phone lines monitored.

149
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:49,640
Boy. And can you remember any of the wording? I mean, you said you signed something that would allow them if you blab to be judged jury. Well, I had signed something like that.

150
00:29:50,390 --> 00:30:14,910
Yeah. I mean, that may be a slight exaggeration of how the wording was, but certainly I signed. I'm trying to remember what it was like a 10/10 agreement, if you've heard that before. I don't remember the exact title of the document, but, you know, it says if you violate the International Security secrets, you're, you know, it's 10 years in jails and a $10,000 fine. Does that sound familiar to you?

151
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:20,200
Yeah, I've signed something like that before, but this is certainly far above and beyond that,

152
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:37,030
which was kind of shocking actually. But at the time, you know, you pretty much just blow it off and say all this means is that I'm going to be involved in something, you know, extremely interesting. And, you know, it's it's great. So what, you know, I'm not I have no intention of violating any rules or,

153
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:49,510
you know, causing any problems. So there's no slack. I understand. I mean, by that time you're you're being you're probably tantalized thinking. Oh, really? I was, you know, it's this is pumped up about

154
00:30:51,320 --> 00:31:03,680
all right, so you sign all the forms, including one to tap your phone, Huh, Right. They did. That was again, before I went down there. That was down at EG and G and I gave him permission to do that,

155
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,440
but that was only for a limited amount of time. I don't recall how long that was for.

156
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:17,350
And Bobby, that's kind of a silly thing to do in the 1st place because if you're going to monitor my phone, why tell me

157
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:40,480
it defeats the purpose? Maybe because otherwise they have to go through some sort of legal procedure and get some sort of court something or another. So maybe you would think in the interest of national security they could circumvent all that, but well, they probably do. I had actually doubted that they were actually doing that.

158
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:46,550
You know, once in a while, everyone here is little clicks and pops and buzzes on their phone. And,

159
00:31:48,150 --> 00:32:12,590
you know, I I really didn't think that was it. Yeah, my view is a good tap is 1. You never hear. Well, this is my point exactly. Sometime later, I guess we'll get into that. But when things turn sour, actually, before they did, they had come to my house 30 minutes after I got off the phone with Gene one day. And we were joking around on the phone. They came to my front door 30 minutes later

160
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,760
with a transcript of our conversation and outlined were were the questionable phrases that I had spoken.

161
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:27,030
Now this is amazing to me, considering the closest FBI building down here is on Charleston and

162
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:32,470
Maryland or or Charlton and Maryland Parkway. But I mean, that's,

163
00:32:33,630 --> 00:33:02,670
you know, that's an amazing feat. It almost makes me think they had a little mobile set up somewhere. Well, it is you're, you're a computer guy. And I've heard maybe you could confirm this for me, that the NSC has the ability to have supercomputers which virtually are monitoring perhaps even millions of conversations, looking not at the entire conversation, but listening for key keywords. Well, that's how they caught that drug kingpin down in

164
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:22,870
Panama or Mexico. That's right. And every single phone line, right, And just picked out certain words and grabbed them. And so I encourage my audience to constantly in the middle of a conversation, just simply say KK Art, actually we say assassination president, things like that.

165
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:34,360
All right. Well, anyway, so so onward to to Area's 4,

166
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:48,630
I guess is is it a paved road or a bumpy little ride? That's a quite a bumpy little ride. It's a dirt Rd. down there, follows along the base of the mountain and coming up to the facility,

167
00:33:49,430 --> 00:34:10,430
it's right off of Papoose dry lake bed and there's a small mountain range on the side. And built right into the side of the mountain is the installation itself, the S4 installation and it's composed of hangar doors around one side. And then I guess I believe on the

168
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:38,390
east, no, on the South facing side there's a, is the main entrance into the facility. Were the windows on the bus darkened or could you see out as you? No, you could. The only place you could see out was the front on the bus. Most of the times I had gone down, there was the driver or security guard and Dennis Mariani, the security guard almost always stood

169
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,080
right up front,

170
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,240
not sitting down, but holding that bar,

171
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:53,470
you know, which is right by the door on those buses. Sure. Uh, in. I don't know if it was an effort to block my view out there or just intimidate me and stare at me,

172
00:34:53,870 --> 00:35:19,110
but that's how he rode the entire trip down there. So it was always difficult to see exactly where we were and what was in between, right? Well, there's really nothing in between. Pretty much desert. Dennis Mariani, Who? Who was he? He was my supervisor. What his exact position was was was pretty much unclear to me. He's a stocky guy,

173
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,680
smokes a a cigar, kind of a very military looking short blonde hair.

174
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:32,230
Umm, it's about the best I could describe it. Maybe, you know, late 30s, early 40s,

175
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:54,360
not gregarious, more security like, yes. So I, I really don't know what his exact function was in the world. He didn't wear a military uniform though, did he, Bobby? No, no, he didn't close right civilian. But you can kind of tell military guys, yeah, just by the way they left and and the way they comport themselves and so forth and so on.

176
00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:10,230
But, you know, again, that's, this is my guesstimation of what sure what this guy was about. Was he your constant shadow? Was he with you all the time? For the most part. For the most part, until I learned how things operated there.

177
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:15,230
Uh, my, I guess I shouldn't jump ahead that far yet.

178
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,720
Well, I might as well for the most part, you know, for science to progress anywhere, if you're doing any sort of research whatsoever,

179
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:50,470
one of the things that is that is vital this free discussion, open and free discussion amongst the people that are working on the project. OK, Right. Well, obviously, you know, it's how ideas are bounced off other people. And that was the only way things can progress. Wasn't that one of the main contentious points during the development of the atomic bomb in the Manhattan Project? Everything was compartmentalized

180
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:58,680
and other military just loves to do that and the scientists just hate it because they want to bounce ideas off each other.

181
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:10,350
So you're saying really in 1989 that was still going on? Well, probably. Well, I don't know how would I know how bad it was during the atomic age. But

182
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:16,390
you know, it was very oppressive, so much so that

183
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:23,070
our job was very compartmentalize. Every aspect was split into groups of people.

184
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:41,310
Groups of people are quite literally two people. You work on the buddy system. In other words, the only person I can talk to, the only person I can discuss anything with, the only person I can relate to is the one person who I work with. Any other aspect of the project? Any other questions

185
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:42,910
are simply not to be asked.

186
00:37:43,750 --> 00:38:10,870
So immediately you're interfering with your progress in that if whatever you're doing interacts with anything else anywhere, you know, you've run into a black wall. You don't even really know if you're the first person to come down and be assigned this task, do you? Exactly that. I wasn't. Oh, really? Yeah. But yeah, you really have no idea what's going on. And I'm sure

187
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:20,320
if you found that while part A connects to Part B, which we're not allowed to see, you know, and you know, I'm sure there would be

188
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:31,290
some way to gain some of that information. But Bob, not only were you not the first person signed that task, but this might be an interesting point to tell them why you were told you were hired.

189
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,800
No, that's true. I was

190
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,950
actually. One of the questions I've always had is why did they hire me?

191
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,640
Certainly for this project,

192
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,640
I would not be the most intelligent,

193
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,560
the most resourceful

194
00:38:54,670 --> 00:39:04,070
person that they could possibly hire out of all the people at Los Alamos or anywhere else in the world for that matter. So I've always wondered exactly why they would have picked me.

195
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:36,200
And so why then did they? I, I still don't know. I have always wondered this. I've ran a lot of things through my mind, you know, a different possible scenarios, and they really none of them make any sense. Was it because Edward Teller just thought I was a nice guy and essentially juiced me into the position? So that makes. Yeah, it sounds that way. Yeah. But, you know, in a project like this, why would something like that happen where every person counts? You're talking in a project where

196
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:46,430
actually 22 active people working on it. Yeah, but when Teller speaks, the military listens. Yeah, that's true. But I mean, I didn't know him well

197
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,520
as far as my scientific background, it was actually fairly limited.

198
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,440
I mean I was working at Los Alamos on the.

199
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,230
Working with the accelerator at that point, so it really wasn't a propulsion based

200
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,190
job. Anything to do with

201
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:26,200
what I was about to have my hands on. Maybe they assumed you did have the right background. Maybe they didn't really know what they had on their hands. Well, one of the, I tell you we're, we're coming up on a break and we'll pick up on this point when we get back. Everybody relax. It'll be a good one.

202
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:37,320
Bob Lazar and Gene Huff are my guests built in. It's going to be a good one. You're listening to our Bells Somewhere in Time,

203
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:43,070
the night featuring a replay of Coast to Coast AM from September 26th, 1997.

204
00:40:44,880 --> 00:41:04,600


205
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:24,880


206
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:45,080


207
00:41:45,350 --> 00:42:09,750
Radio Networks presents art bells somewhere in time. The night program originally aired September 26th, 1997. For those of you who want a Dannion Brinkley update. And I'm getting a lot of faxes. The news just keeps getting better and better guarded, but better. Not only has he out of intensive care, but he's out of the hospital as of late afternoon and convalescing

208
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,960
at a undisclosed location so he can get some real rest.

209
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:31,190
That is the latest it goes. Well, I'll keep you updated as I can. Next update coming Sunday on DREAMLAND. I'm Art Bell, Bob Lazar and Gene Huffer, my guests, and the story that you're about to hear unfold is indeed

210
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:40,120
an amazing, amazing story. So, you know, turn up the volume, don't move, rivet yourself and stand by.

211
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,920


212
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:15,280
Back now to Bob Lazar and Gene Huff. And the story continues. Here we are at Area S4 South of Groom Lake. And I guess by now you're in great anticipation, Bob, wondering what you're going to be doing.

213
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,670
I was actually, I was just about to make a point

214
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:34,990
before we broke and I can't remember it. Well, that's why you have Gene Huff. Gene doesn't remember either. Gene doesn't remember either. Think my short term memory before we broke about. He had no idea why they chose him. Of all the people in the world.

215
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,840
Actually, Gene, you had said. Why don't you tell him, Bob, Why they chose you

216
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:52,680
said I have no idea. And we were talking about the work he did at Los Alamos. Yeah, he was. I was implying something else. And in other words, I was, I was telling him,

217
00:43:53,430 --> 00:44:04,710
reminding him of why there were vacancies, why they needed to hire someone. That's why someone wasn't in his slaughter. And we were talking about the fact that he was not the first one necessarily.

218
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:31,190
Uh, and that makes sense. In other words, uh, if they had something they didn't understand, I can imagine they would bring in a, an array of people of different disciplines to take a look. See. Well, my, that might have been the case, but yeah, you know, I, to this day I can't figure out why, you know, if, uh, certainly you look at my record and the way I approach things and the work I had done before was a little more renegade and maybe that's what they were doing,

219
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,520
uh, was looking for someone that would approach a project

220
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:45,870
from a different road. And are you able to talk about what you did at Los Alamos? I did several things initially. I was

221
00:44:47,990 --> 00:45:12,590
working on the polarized proton target on the accelerator. The accelerator there at Los Alamos is a linear accelerator. It stretches about, if I remember, about 1/2 mile. And it's one of the more unique setups in that instead of running a single experiment on the output of the accelerator, the beam is split into different areas.

222
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,280
And all these different areas

223
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,880
are, I don't know really if they're least, or rented to other countries or other scientists.

224
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:31,150
Uh, but several other people and other groups from all over the world essentially can conduct experiments simultaneously

225
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:46,040
at different times. They'll fire different particles down the target for different lengths of time. And, you know, everyone can run their own experiments and, you know, see what's going on. There is also some Star Wars development done there.

226
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:54,320
OK, I'm, I'm sitting here listening, trying to imagine any application for what you were about to do.

227
00:45:55,870 --> 00:46:07,030
And you don't at S4. Yeah, there's there's none. There was no, there was no direct connection at all. This is, you know, one of the things that has perplexed me forever.

228
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:24,320
But how could there be? But maybe this was the point that I was going to make. In fact, it is. It just popped back in my mind. What was strange about the interviews I had had was, you know, certainly there was some technical questions here and there.

229
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:29,310
Umm. They essentially knew my background already, but

230
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:39,630
what they were most concerned was what I had done in my spare time, which I found to be very unusual.

231
00:46:40,870 --> 00:47:11,550
Now, what had you done in your spare time? You had worked with propulsion systems in your spare time, right? I mean, they were essentially concerned with more of my, you know, for lack of a better word, play time than they were what what I was or what I had currently done. All right, well, let's take this back to Edward Teller. When you had a conversation with Edward Teller, did you talk about your playtime? Did you talk about, well, I was talking about at that time the static ramjet engine that,

232
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:42,430
that was in fact, that was in the front of the paper. Uh-huh. So we were talking about uh, in fact, at that time I had filed patents on it, umm, of how the device operated uh, without the name for fuel pumps and things of that sort because of the type of fuel it used. Umm, what is a static ramjet engine? It was an offshoot of a pressure jet engine, which is, uh, which was invented by Eugene Gluharf, who was also coincidentally the inventor of

233
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:46,630
of the rocket ejection seat that's used on all fighter aircraft.

234
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,000
He developed that, I believe in the 50s and in the 70s I had run into him

235
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:02,680
and really as a kid back then started working in my spare time as I went to Pierce College at that time

236
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,760
working to improve on the design. I came off with an offshoot of the design which

237
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:20,870
was a little more complicated but produced a lot more thrust. The basic design of the engine is it has no moving parts at all.

238
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:35,550
Umm, one property of propane is that it sticks to hot metal. This eliminates all the needs for flame holders and things of that sort inside the engine, which makes it more complicated.

239
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:51,640
I'm trying to think of a couple other points about it. It was a pretty different design as far as jet engines go, and with the changes I made, it was essentially a different type of engine.

240
00:48:52,270 --> 00:49:23,230
And after I had gone past the development of it on a test stand, I've built a slightly larger one and installed it in the back of a car. And it was a convenient mobile test setup as opposed well. And additionally, it was something kind of interesting to play around with in the desert, which is where the whole article came from in the newspaper. But all right. Well then I think you've answered your own question. But someone playing around with jet engines really doesn't qualify.

241
00:49:24,310 --> 00:49:34,510
Qualify him or her to work on something of extraterrestrial origin? No, but but then again, who does have qualifications to go work on something?

242
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:53,800
So I I can understand and if here's how I would based on what you said, I'll bet here's what happened. The article in the paper the conversation with Edward Teller and probably his suggestion, which probably amounts to more of an order

243
00:49:54,310 --> 00:50:21,910
that you'd be a good good person kind of a revel to go take a look at this stuff they had at area S forum. That's that would be my best guess. That's a pretty good guess what what do you think Gene? I agree. I think that Edward Tellers were carried all of the weight in the world and and and I also agree with you that who would have a background who would be qualified to work on,

244
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,760
you know, a gravity propulsion system and an antimatter reactor and the things Bob later ran into

245
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:58,710
and Bob's a comprehensive problem solver as a background in physics and electronics and in propulsion. And and I can understand why they'd hire. Well, yeah, if you're going to go if if you really have extraterrestrial craft and you're trying to figure out what makes them go, then you're going to go find somebody who works out-of-the-box. In other words, is a bit of a rebel and and kind of works out of the normal box and experiments and tinkers and is interested in propulsion. That's the kind of person you're

246
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:12,510
go for because there's nobody out there with specific qualifications for that job, obviously, in addition to probably other considerations of a psychological profile. And you know, yeah, that they were also very concerned with

247
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:37,710
your psychological profile. Yeah. They were concerned with how I handle stress. In fact, I remember one of the one of the questions was, you know, have you ever thrown tools around in the lab or anything to that effect? And that these are very strange questions for what, you know, what we were talking about. But, well, in either case, I, you know, I got the job and and and wound up there. But

248
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:44,200
haven't you ever thrown tools? No, actually I haven't. I have. I've kicked radios too,

249
00:51:45,190 --> 00:52:12,990
one all the way across the room, put my foot through it Anyway. So so then you seem qualified in most every way, as much as one could be qualified for that. So here you come to ask for. And were you immediately led into this area where these craft were? No, absolutely not. In fact, the first day there, I went in and I think my first stop was to go to the medical office there. I believe there was a nurse in there.

250
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,200


251
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:32,480
I'm pretty sure that was my first stop, and I had to go through a series of what I was told were allergen tests. Allergen tests? Yeah, they took my arm and drew a little graph on it and pricked each

252
00:52:33,310 --> 00:53:01,910
little area, uh, in my arm with a different little needle. No kidding. And in fact, I was not permitted back to work and I think for two weeks until there was a reaction or if there was debris reaction with any of the substances they put on my skin. And they said, you know, we're working with some extremely exotic materials here, uh, that were not all that familiar with and we want to know if there's going to be any problem with it. And I said, well, that's

253
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:26,350
again, odd, but acceptable. And I was also given an injection there too, which was a yeah, which was a wide spectrum. What did they call it? Antibiotic? No, it wasn't a white spectrum antibiotic. It was a wide spectrum something or other. Hmm. It's always good to know what they're shooting you with. Yeah,

254
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,160
I thought now. I mean, there have been so many,

255
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:59,670
I'm sure, which we'll get into later, you know, so many ridiculous stories, offshoots of what actually had happened to me. You know, people said, oh, well, they injected you with Thorazine or so on, or this was the memory drug that wiped out your memory so you could only remember back and forth and, you know, so on and so forth. But pretty sure that wasn't the case. This was they were mainly concerned about the, you know, here you're dealing with actual extraterrestrial materials.

256
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:08,400
And if we're going to be crawling around on them, taking things apart and having contact with them, you know, they imagine they want to make sure

257
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:12,080
that the people working on it are fairly safe.

258
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:23,510
That in one hand, weighed against the fact that, you know, don't forget, the United States government fed fallout to people from time to time. You bet. And, you know, did other strange things to him. But,

259
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:48,750
and, and, and when you originally, when you originally told your story, Bob, years ago, that wasn't known. Hazel O'Leary was not around yet. And, and everybody regarded your story as absolutely incredible beyond belief. But then when Hazel O'Leary stepped out and said the following occurred, everybody went into kind of a stupor and said, my God, we did that.

260
00:54:49,430 --> 00:55:18,470
So your story isn't so out of a lot has actually changed in the past 10 years. If you remember, you know, 10 years ago too, the predominant theory about how gravity propagates in any physics textbook, you know, related to gravitons. And now the predominant theory is gravitational waves, which is exactly how some of, and some scientists and physicists at that time, you know, pointed out one of the many reasons they say

261
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,800
the, the reason this story can't be true was that this was absolutely ridiculous, so on and so forth. And now it's

262
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:50,150
spoken of, as a matter of fact, this is how gravity propagates through space. And it's just interesting to see how things slowly, over the span of a decade quietly change, you know? And that's one thing I do keep an eye on. But I take it your arm didn't break out inappropriately. So you passed. Now I think, I think it did develop a small eruption somewhere, but it was nothing,

263
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,440
nothing to be concerned about, or so I was told.

264
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,680
So we just proceeded from there.

265
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:07,830
As you know, there is a group of people suing the government over illnesses they have suffered from work they did at Area 51

266
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:23,790
and that is proceeding quietly in court. It's not going to be so quiet when it goes to trial, but that's underway now. So indeed, there are some pretty exotic materials up there. Actually. You just reminded me of something. When was that gene? When

267
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:30,670
was it right after that where I collapsed from the kidney?

268
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:57,990
Remember that? And you had, was that there after I had left the project? No, you were still in the project. That was right after that, after they did these tests and gave, you know, it's kind of surprising. I forget that strange substance. And all I remember is that you were at a Toyota dealer or something like that. And he was in, he was in such pain as kidneys hurt so bad he thought he was going to die. And to that point, Bob had

269
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,200
never had any health problems or had never had any sedatives or painkillers. And

270
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,190
the doctor gave Bob a shot of

271
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:36,200
and I called him and I was floating on cloud nine. It wasn't even coherent. And I came to his house to say what what was wrong. And then he was literally, literally high from from a painkiller they gave him just so he could stand the the pain in his kidneys. So whatever went through his system certainly stuck there. Yeah. So there was an adverse reaction to something. Do you think that was? Well, of course, you have no way of knowing whether it was the allergy test they put you through or the shot they gave or wasn't an, you know, an amazing coincidence that,

272
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:44,270
you know, so prior kidney problems. Yeah. I mean, it is, you know. Well, I take it you went to the doctor.

273
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:46,990
I did, yeah. What do you say?

274
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:57,150
I don't remember. I think he said he gave me a shot of painkiller Demerol, I believe it was, and

275
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:14,130
he took a urine sample, a blood test, and he asked if I had any previous problems, anything strange. And you know, obviously I said no, no, no, Certainly didn't mention anything about getting an injection in a strange place in the middle of a desert.

276
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:22,640
Didn't they do X-rays or a CAT scan or something and find a CAT scan? They did a yeah, they did a just an X-ray to see if there was any blockage.

277
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:31,520
But there was a day later or I think even the next morning, everything was fine.

278
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:37,550
The X-rays came back negative, and I believe the blood work came back negative, too, as did the urine sample.

279
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:55,830
So in fact, I think his conclusion was that perhaps I had passed a small stone and, you know, wound up in my bladder and then it would probably hurt coming out again. But, you know, that never occurred. And, you know, whether or not that scenario is correct, you know, again, it's just speculation,

280
00:58:56,270 --> 00:59:11,550
but I don't know that you just stirred that up in my memory. I don't, you know, I don't think I that's right. That's how little bits and pieces come back. How's your health now, by the way? And and since then, OK. Oh, fine. No problem. All right,

281
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:27,560
so anyway, you pass all their little tests, pass all that. The next thing to happen was that I was let into a room with quite a number of little briefing packages.

282
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:40,710
Umm, briefing papers or. These range from 2 pages to about 5 pages. Little folders with different aspects of the project

283
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,040
that I was working on.

284
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:48,030
This was, I believe, the

285
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:51,070
part of the first day

286
00:59:52,070 --> 01:00:19,550
and the second day that I was working there. So they just sent you down at a table and had you begin to read about. Yeah, what? These were just basic overviews of what each group was doing. Just essentially to give you knowledge of what the other facets of the project were about. A general overall, right, Had no specifics whatsoever. But if in for instance there was a group of metallurgy.

287
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,520
And so on and so forth.

288
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:32,460
Well, it also contains some of the names of the projects. Oh, it did. Yeah. All right. That's a good place to break. So relax. We'll be back shortly.

289
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:57,550
The story you're hearing is a remarkable 1 and we're beginning to hear new details because Bobby remembering new details. Bob Lazar and Gene Huff are my guests. The subject Area 51, more specifically Area S4, whereas you will hear shortly extra terrestrial craft were back engineered. Yes, that's what Bob did.

290
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:11,120
I'm Art Bell and this is Coast to Coast AM. You're listening to Art Bells Somewhere in Time on Premiere Radio Networks tonight, an encore presentation of Coast to Coast AM from September 26th, 1997.

291
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:30,880


292
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:51,320


293
01:01:51,320 --> 01:02:11,520


294
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:30,750
You're listening to Art Bell Somewhere in Time on Premiere Radio Networks tonight, an encore presentation of Costa Costa M from September 26th, 1997. Well, here I am, and Bob Lazar and Gene Huffer here. It's the story of a lifetime

295
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:42,500
and we're trying to develop it slowly and get as many details as we can. But we're about to get to the very interesting part here, so hang with us.

296
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:51,000


297
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:21,160
Now back to Bob Lazar and Gene Huff. Now you're welcome to fax in a question. As a matter of fact, I already have many, but I'm going to hold them until the story unfolds completely. Then we'll ask some of the facts questions, then we'll go to the phones. So if you're dialing finger is itchy and it is because they're all ringing,

298
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:42,390
just relax. We'll get to the phones in due time. Right now, let us unwind the story back to Bob Lazar and Gene Huff. Gentlemen, you're back on the air again. All right, so here we are. You're in a little room with a bunch of briefing papers giving you more or less an outline, but not specifics of what of the work being done

299
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:54,640
on. Actually, at that point, did they state what it was that was being worked on? Well, at this point, yeah. This is the first time I really knew exactly

300
01:03:55,230 --> 01:03:56,830
what I would be doing

301
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,000
and this is where it was stated that

302
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:17,710
the project, excuse me, the project was essentially that of back engineering and extraterrestrial craft. That must be quite a line to read. Well, it was and it was also hard to believe because certainly going into the project

303
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:24,720
basically on nuts and bolts guy and certainly didn't believe in UFOs and thought everyone was crazy

304
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:32,120
that even considered the topic. I certainly believe that there was life elsewhere.

305
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,910
Certainly life can

306
01:04:34,990 --> 01:05:01,470
exist on other planets, other galaxies, other other solar systems, but I just found it very hard to believe that there is any intelligent life visiting Earth. And you had never had any close encounter of the third kind. No, no. And I thought people were basically crackpots that thought whacked out. But also art. He was into science and technology and he certainly wasn't well read. I mean, he had never heard of the, you know, Betty and Barney Hill case or he didn't know anything about

307
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:09,520
the the Roswell crash or anything along those lines. I mean, he wasn't interested and he didn't pursue it. And, and if you all remember,

308
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:33,790
uh, really a decade ago, I mean, some of that information was available, but certainly wasn't prevalent to the point that it is today with websites and movies and television shows. Oh, indeed. As a matter of fact, before we proceed, Bob, I'd be very, very interested to hear your reaction. I have interviewed now twice, uh, very rare interviews, by the way, uh, hours long interviews with Colonel Philip Corso.

309
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:51,910
And I'm kind of interested to get your reaction to Colonel Corso's revelations about the back engineering and insertion into American industry he did of artifacts from the Roswell crash. Were you surprised to hear about that?

310
01:05:53,800 --> 01:06:22,080
This is the first I'm hearing about this. Is that right? What is All right, Phillip. Phillip J Corso. Colonel, I believe it or not, I really am completely uninterested in the topic UFOs and and never follow it at all. All right. Well, this in the dark as well as this is a man who was given the job. He's now 82 years of age, by the way. He was given the job of, he was actually handed a filing cabinet,

311
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:46,270
uh, by a general. And he was given a job of figuring out what some of these things were and introducing them into American industry, specifically Bell Labs and some others at the time. And these were artifacts from Roswell. And he is very, very credible. He wrote a book called The Day After Roswell. What specifically

312
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:55,920
what devices, umm, devices that led to And I'm going to it's going to be hard. A night vision scopes, for example,

313
01:06:56,310 --> 01:07:20,030
fiber optics, for example, the transistor, for example, a lot of leaps that by the way, particularly the transistor, there's not much of a paper trail for if you look back at the development in Bell Labs of the transistor, there's not a big paper trail. Yes, it arrived, but there's not a big paper trail about how it arrived.

314
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:47,910
I'm so skeptical of something like that. The reason being, well, let me tell you, certainly you've seen pictures of the first transistor. We know it was developed at Bell Labs. We know there are a couple of guys working on it. But you know what the first transistor was? It was essentially just, I mean, it was more along lines of a diode, just a APAPN and AP junction is on a big slab of silicon. It really couldn't do anything. Certainly

315
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:50,280
if we had

316
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:53,910
been given that advanced technology,

317
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,480
wouldn't it have been something

318
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:01,430
a little more down the road?

319
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:28,140
A lot of it was a lot of it they had no idea. And well, is he saying that he worked with some of these guys or hinted no them or, or was this all a a big conspiracy and everyone was no, he was a he was just a middleman. And he is assignment was to take something that looked interesting and take it to American industry and try and determine the function

320
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:47,040
and whether it could be duplicated or not. It's a long story and I don't want to burden you with it, but he's he's highly qualified. I mean, this guy is I'm not I'm not immediately debunking him, but I'm, you know, this is my natural reaction to jump on that. He was an officer in the military and held some very lofty positions, right?

321
01:08:47,430 --> 01:09:12,310
Oh, absolutely. Well, I'd actually be interested to look at that. I actually gave him UFO magazine so he could read about it. But he doesn't read about UFOs, so I understand really, his truth. People don't believe this about you, Bob. They think you are the guru of ufology. Boy, have you got the wrong guy. And it just isn't true. You see, I remember the interview I did with you before.

322
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:14,080
I remembered very well. Anyway,

323
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,680
so here you are reading about all of this and

324
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:28,790
you get sort of an overview of it all and probably by what are you thinking by then? I mean, is your mouth hanging open extraterrestrial? It is to some extent, and

325
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:34,630
another part of me is beginning to wonder whether or not this is true at all

326
01:09:36,330 --> 01:10:03,170
or if this is some sort of psychological test. You know, everything else was so way out, essentially. Maybe this is, you know, another game that we're playing. Maybe they're just trying to determine what reactions of people in science would be too extraterrestrial craft or the fact of extraterrestrial presence of any kind at all. Right. And, and certainly all these thoughts had gone through my mind

327
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,480
from there.

328
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:17,220
Umm, yeah, the days have kind of blended together in my mind. I don't it's hard to separate what happened on each day after that, but I believe

329
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,200
that the next time I went, there

330
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:28,550
was the time that I was actually let in

331
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:36,670
through one of the hangar doors. Now normally we drove alongside of the installation and came in the main entrance.

332
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:43,040
This one time we drove up in one of the hangar doors was open.

333
01:10:44,470 --> 01:11:02,070
Uh-huh. In the hangar doors as plain as day or in the hangar door, uh, as plain as day was the craft that I had later labeled the sport model, a very sleek looking, uh, very stereotypical flying saucer.

334
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:34,030
My immediate reaction was this is the new generation fighter that we're working on For whatever reason, it's saucer shaped. But immediately in my mind, I said this explains all the UFO sightings throughout history has just been the development of this thing. Here it is right here It is. It makes you know perfect. I've got a model 5 feet away from me here, a tester model which I believe the tester corporation built based on

335
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:43,710
description. Right. It looked exactly like that. Is that what we're talking about? The sport model? You you call the sport model? Yeah. Very sleek, sporty looking.

336
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:46,790
Yeah, that's it exactly.

337
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:56,310
I'll be damned. All right, so you drove by this thing. We actually stopped in front. I was led out

338
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:17,510
of the bus, the security guard first, then Dennis and myself. Dennis walked on ahead of Maine and the security guard told me to keep my eyes forward and just follow Dennis into the back. And at the back of the hangar, there was a door that led into a hallway in the office area.

339
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:26,430
I walked right by the craft. The door was off the craft. Or Hatch, whatever you want to call it.

340
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:39,870
Right alongside of it was an American flag. Adhere to it. A little sticker? Not really. Now that all that did was cemented in my mind saying, well this is obviously this is it.

341
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,000
I I slipped my hand along the side of the craft,

342
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:59,040
which the guard didn't appreciate, and I was told again, keep my hands at my side. What did it feel like forward? I say it felt like metal. And the reason I say that is because it was cool to the touch.

343
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:08,630
So yes, it could have been an advanced ceramic or something, absolutely. But to me it felt and it appeared like metal.

344
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,480
We continued in, and this is where I first met

345
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:22,880
the person that I'd be working with, Barry Castillo or Castile, however you pronounce that.

346
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:30,920
And this is when I first saw the initial components of the craft that had been taken out.

347
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:43,670
So they had begun to gut this thing then? Not this particular one. There was more than one there. How many? There were actually 9 craft, not all like this but

348
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:58,320
from what they told me, from what I saw there were nine craft. And don't ask me where they came from or how we got them or anything I have no idea. But the craft were in different,

349
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:03,520
really different states. Some were completely dismantled,

350
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,600
some looked as if they would be operational. You know that they hadn't been touched at all,

351
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,800
but apparently, from what I understand,

352
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:27,270
all the crafts had the exact same reactor and propulsion system in them. Did any of the craft look look as though they had been in a collision or crash?

353
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:31,750
No, the only one that had

354
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:40,270
damage to it looked intentional. It was a crap that had a A.

355
01:14:43,440 --> 01:15:08,680
It's kind of hard to describe, but the area around the craft, the lip if you will, was very broad and flat and thin, and it looked as if it had been stood up in a projectile fired through it. The hole from the distance that I saw looked around 4 inches but it could have been at any size, just it looked as if the metal was been outward

356
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:16,120
and now that could have been dropped from the sky. Someone could have fired a projectile through it.

357
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:17,630
Who knows? Again,

358
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:46,520
in other words, we're not dealing with Superman's Cape here. Holes could be blown through it, right? Of course, on the other hand, it's an extremely unscientific test. You take something as prized as that, you don't stand it up and fire a cannon at the thing or a howitzer. You certainly, you know, take a small quantity off and, you know, do your analysis of that, that piece. But for whatever reason, that was the only one that looked like it sustained any damage.

359
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:49,670
Umm, some of the other craft were

360
01:15:50,630 --> 01:16:17,910
dismantled to some point, but certainly not wrecked. The only craft that I was permitted to work on, to touch, to have anything to do with was the craft that I termed the sport model. That's the one that you have a model of there. Well, as you turn around as you walk in on all of this though, Bob, no, I did not see this all at one time. This is I saw this one craft and the hanger doors are all the hangers are all next to each other and only at one time.

361
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:28,920
You know, way down the road where all the Bay doors open at one time. And I got a glance to see in what was the other in the other hangar doors. But for the most part, all I at this point, all I knew

362
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:46,790
was that there was this one craft. And now in my mind, I am convinced that this is just a US manufactured extremely secret, you know, fighter reconnaissance craft, who knows what. But without question, that was it. It's a done deal.

363
01:16:48,430 --> 01:17:07,630
So what do you say? You look at it and say, turn around to your companion, we'll call him and say wow or my God or where did these come from? No, nothing all. I just had a smile on my face, if I remember, walked into the back door and then, you know, the introductions began. The only other person I really interfaced with was

364
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:11,430
Renee. I don't remember his last name

365
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:14,800
but

366
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:22,980
and I actually can't remember what in the world Renee did, but for the most part Barry and I worked closely together.

367
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,280
Now, this is also the first time that

368
01:17:29,160 --> 01:17:30,360
my supervisor left me alone

369
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:37,080
with Barry. And, you know, this is where the learning process essentially began.

370
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:47,840
This is where my view of everything changed. Did they tell you at that point what your specific job was? In other words, there it is.

371
01:17:48,350 --> 01:18:05,910
And it's sort of like, OK, what am I supposed to do? Well, that's what this, you know, that that's where we begin. Now. This is exactly what this meeting with Barry entails is the description of precisely what I'm supposed to be working on with my function. And life is now at this place.

372
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:17,400
And this is where I find out that we are essentially, well, number one, that the briefings I was reading are correct. In other words, they are extraterrestrial,

373
01:18:17,870 --> 01:18:38,630
right? These craft are not extraterrestrial. The the scope, the aim of our project is now to back engineer these craft or this one particular craft with the intention of duplicating it or duplicating the subsystems within it using earthly materials.

374
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:40,590
So

375
01:18:41,470 --> 01:18:54,790
that was the project. Now this hit me quite hard at that time and Needless to say now this night I didn't get any sleep. It was fairly exciting before that, but I

376
01:18:56,830 --> 01:19:03,470
and and certainly Barry just telling me this wasn't enough. This is when we also had some demonstrations on what we had found out

377
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:10,000
or what information had been had been gleaned so far from the technology that we've seen.

378
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:26,880
You know, it was all very fantastic. And I mean, it was absolutely mind boggling. Well, I know you don't follow all this, but I have to ask, have you seen Independence Day? Oh, absolutely. Oh, OK good. At least you've done that.

379
01:19:28,070 --> 01:19:41,270
You remember when they brought everybody into Area 51 and they opened the big door and you want to say, well, they they invited me to the premiere of that. Oh, they did, yeah. In fact, they made me stand up for some reason.

380
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,800
Yeah. And does He introduced me. I see. But

381
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:49,270
in fact, someone called,

382
01:19:50,880 --> 01:20:01,880
I don't remember the people involved there, but when they were talking about the movie, The making of the movie, so on and so forth, the lab technician there.

383
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:18,090
I don't remember his name in the movie, but who wore the white lab coat they called the Bob Lazar guy? Dean Devlin was the writer. I don't remember the other people that were there, but I thought that was pretty funny.

384
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:20,670
But as they said, they had taken

385
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:37,200
the for the movie, they had taken much of the UFO lower stories and everything that had been circulating around for years and, you know, threw together the script in a short time and, you know, produced it. So that wasn't great. It looked nothing like that by the way. But

386
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:42,150
you know the idea was the same, say, right? Same idea.

387
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:49,120
All right, well, we're at an interesting juncture here and the real fun is about to begin.

388
01:20:50,510 --> 01:21:21,320
Were you told that you were going to be working on one specific area of back engineering or were you going only power and propulsion system and everything else is essentially off limits, meaning you couldn't even touch it? No, couldn't touch it. However, I did get I did get to go on the craft one time. And this was for the express purpose of only seeing the placement of the reactor and how the the gravity amplifiers worked,

389
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:43,350
how the emitters moved freely underneath on the primary level, and just how all the subcomponents, you know, fit together. All right, that's a good place to hold it. We're at the top of the hour. Take a good few moments to relax and we'll be right back. And we will kind of recap at the top of the hour, and then you're going to hear

390
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:52,910
about an extraterrestrial craft, what it looked like, what the power and propulsion systems were,

391
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:56,950
how they worked. And believe me, much more.

392
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:00,240
It's not Independence Day,

393
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:22,110
but it's the same idea, except in this case, it's for real. From the high deserts, an area near Dreamland, this is Coast to Coast. You're listening to Art Bells Somewhere in Time, the night featuring a replay of Coast to Coast AM from September 26th, 1997.

394
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:50,920


395
01:22:50,920 --> 01:23:11,120


396
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:31,320


397
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:57,590
You're listening to Art Bells Somewhere in Time, the night featuring a replay of Poster Coast AM from September 26th, 1997. Good morning, everybody. What an unusual, rare opportunity, one that may not come along for a while. Incidentally,

398
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,280
my guests are Bob Lazar and Gene Huff.

399
01:24:01,990 --> 01:24:33,110
Lazar is the ex government scientist who back in 1989 came forward with the fact that he had been part of a team of scientists who back engineered extraterrestrial discs, flying saucers at a base known as S 415 miles South of the infamous Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada. Along with him, Gene Huff, Bob's longtime friend and business partner, packed really all these years, who's a writer and Co producer of the Lazar tape, which we'll tell you about,

400
01:24:33,870 --> 01:24:54,990
is a real estate appraiser and screenwriter. As a matter of fact, he has written the screenplay and has won the competition for that. As for the Bob Lazar story, and in the first two hours of the program, we've moved through Bob Lazar's employment, early employment

401
01:24:56,510 --> 01:24:57,710
in New Mexico,

402
01:24:59,380 --> 01:25:29,640
ah, to his introduction to Edward Teller to his employment finally. And we've had a lot of details we've never heard before at Area S4. And we have just arrived at the point in the story where he has met up with what he calls the sport model craft. And I've got a studio Cam here and I will endeavor over the next 30 minutes to take a good picture of the Tester model, which is said to be a faithful reproduction.

403
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:42,230
And we'll confirm that with Bob of what he saw. I've got one right here, by the way, you can get one of those from Tester. So all of that and a bit of a surprise coming up in a moment.

404
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:06,960
Now back to my guest, Bob Lazar and Gene Huff. And gentlemen, I have a surprise for you,

405
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:28,590
Bob. You were in effect, recruited, I think, by Edward Teller. I have a friend who's listening to the show this morning as we speak, believe it or not, all the way down in Perth, Australia. His name is Stan Dale and he was also recruited by Edward Teller

406
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:46,910
and he's got a question or two for you. I'm going to see if we can bring him up all the way from Perth, Australia. There's a slight delay in the phone line transmission. Stan, are you there? Yeah, OK, very good. Bob Lazar is on the line, and I know you followed the Lazar story

407
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:51,670
and you might briefly, just very briefly recap yours and ask a question.

408
01:26:52,590 --> 01:27:11,470
All right, Very briefly. I was working in the computer business in Dallas in 19. Oh, I think it was 7071. And I, among other things, I was also doing some investigation for the FBI at the Corporation Square. I was working as an undercover kind of plan

409
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:21,160
during this time at this company where I was working was a large corporation. It was called Valtex Optical at the time had 100 sub corporations

410
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:37,390
and a lot of them operated in Nevada. And during the time I was there, I was approached by one of the senior executives of this company to go meet with a doctor, James R Maxfield, at the Radiation Research Clinic over a couple miles from where we had the office in Dallas.

411
01:27:38,390 --> 01:28:09,230
And I didn't go for about a month. And then I met this same executive at a morning coffee and the executive tea room. And he said to me, I hadn't been to see his friend Maxfield. And the reason he'd asked me to go is because I had talked to him about some work that I've been doing in my time off, my private time at home and my own laboratory working with two things. One was a thermionic electrical converter and the other was a rather novel method, I thought, of propelling a flying

412
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:28,830
aircraft which was circular shaped and, you know, flying saucer. You call them today. Anyway, in the course of having told this guy just over coffee, well, he kind of got reasonably interested in it and tell me how to go talk to a friend of his and didn't do it. So 30 days passed and he said to me, look, you haven't been to see Jim Maxville yet. Please go this afternoon. I booked you an appointment at 3:00.

413
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:56,350
So I go over this place, and it's not like a place that saves people very often. It was open. The door was kind of ajar, but there was no cars in front of it. And daylight. And I walked in. The lights were off down the hallway. And I walked down the hallway and it was kind of dark. And suddenly this nurse, well, I guess a receptionist appears out of nowhere from the side. Yes. Can I help you? I said, oh, Gee, I didn't know anybody was here. Look, I I think I've got the right building. I'm looking for this doctor, James R Maxfield,

414
01:28:57,240 --> 01:29:08,160
and she's Oh yes, Doctor Maxwell is here. He'll be out in just a second. He's down the lab. And so sure enough, within a minute or so, this big tall dude comes out in a white medical coat,

415
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:16,550
smoking a cigar, wearing cowboy boots. He says, Oh yes, yes, I've been expecting you. Come on into my office. And at this time is when I first got introduced to

416
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:28,200
this clandestine organization in the United States that was headed by Doctor Edward Teller and who Maxwell worked with with Teller. And this organization

417
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:39,560
had been working since the mid 50s on something like 50 some odd projects all related directly to flying saucer technology, if you wish to put it down to that level.

418
01:29:40,640 --> 01:30:06,160
I was just the late Comer on the scene. They showed me about their base down to South Poland, the ice cap. I had to access it by submarine or something similar. And they explained to me they knew what I was doing. They even knew what I was thinking version because they asked me about my physics. And I said well, look, thinking I was talking to some of the greatest physicists in the world, which which I was, I didn't have my degree in that area. And you know, I said, well, look, guys,

419
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:13,640
Sir, you know, I've been working on a way to to unify gravitational, electromagnetic and magnetic effects.

420
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:33,110
And he said, oh, look, spare me all that. He said you're working on anti gravity and let's get to the maybe no matter how are you doing it? And that's when they started or when he started telling me that I need to finish my research with them down in Australia instead of America. And that's why I'm here today because those guys packed me up and sent me down here. We parted ways

421
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:47,800
in 1972 or three, I think it was. I was only with him for about a year and I got rather disenchanted with all the technology they were holding back from the people. I still was young enough to think

422
01:30:48,710 --> 01:31:18,590
that we could that we could save the world by giving technology to, you know, countries needed food and grain and water and stuff shipped back and forth rather rapidly. But anyway, because of that, we parted ways in a in a real huff and I kind of hid in the Bush for a while because they they really kind of thought be better if I was buried. And then after coming out of that, I wrote the book that caused conspiracy to kind of be insurance and told a lot of what I had gone through in there and left the rest for I'll tell the rest if

423
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:22,310
get short with me. So now that's my side. Bob,

424
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:40,160
did you run out of my story? Did you ever run into Jim Maxwell at all on your side of it? No, I haven't actually. Now you. I've got 1000 questions now, but one of the prominent one on my mind here is what? What function? What was Teller's function?

425
01:31:41,230 --> 01:31:52,510
Well, you seem to be in charge or overseer of all the projects at the highest level. That's all that I was told. See, this is something I've always wondered about the project down down where I worked. And,

426
01:31:53,830 --> 01:32:00,470
you know, no one had really ever spoke of them, but I got just a gut feeling that he was

427
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:03,750
silently in charge of everything. And

428
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:14,560
what you're saying is also very interesting because a lot of what you're talking about seems to mimic some of the things we were working on.

429
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:29,680
In fact, Bob, when if I remember, I wouldn't Teller called you when you originally got the call from him to contact the gentleman at EG and G Teller said that he was no longer active but worked in a chief consultant capacity. That's right,

430
01:32:31,270 --> 01:32:56,510
something happened after I left because in fact, I'll tell you, I had minders appointed down here who really run this country and and run the prime ministers. My minders operate out of a group called the Melbourne Club and they're, you know, the old kind of British Raj, you know, cigars and port white haired guys. Anyway, they brought me into their halls of power and I had lunch a few times with the kingpins there and my my mentor was

431
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,680
served John Williams and Henry Somerset.

432
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:22,030
Henry Somerset. Anyway, we were sitting there one day at lunch and they were talking amongst themselves about someone moving in on them or they were like, like an undeclared war status and that they were losing. And they never mentioned aliens and all that kind of stuff. So, so don't jump the gun. But I, you know, I heard them say, well, yeah, Henry, it looks like

433
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:51,350
we're gonna lose this. You know, they're, they're just moving in. And I waited and nothing else was said. And I said, well, excuse me, gentlemen. I said by they, you know, think I'd be clever. I said, you mean the European Economic Community, because we've been talking, you know, large corporate or, or money deals in the country. And they both look at me like I've, you know, done a route at the table or something and said, oh, maybe we'll do some fishing up the farm this weekend. Henry. Yes, John. And you know, immediately I knew that I asked a question that I should have known the answer to already and didn't.

434
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:52,830
Anyway,

435
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:57,160
they indicated at that point that they were being taken over.

436
01:33:58,070 --> 01:34:23,590
I got away with the organization and wrote the book and all that years past and about seven years ago. I have a friend in Scottsdale, AZ named Conrad Murphy. And Conrad goes to a lot of places and he's a boats and cars and he's, you know, fairly active fellow in business. Anyway, Connor is invited to give the morning devotional at some big business breakfast, like for the, you know, Arizona 500 Club or something like that.

437
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:32,000
And and so he rang me, says, look, guess who I'm going to give the, the, you know, the breakfast benediction right next to who's sitting right next to me next week

438
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:58,510
is, you know, Edward Teller. And I said, wow. I said, can you get to Doctor Teller and say, you know, take a message, I want to talk to him. He said not a problem. So I waited and waited and the week passed and Conrad rang me back and he says, wow. He says, well, I sat next to him and he said, you know, it was all kind of, you know, normal conversation, give the benediction, eat a bit. And he says after he had a couple of bites, I said to him, look, what do you know about

439
01:34:59,640 --> 01:35:03,920
this fellow named Stan Deyo, you know, down in Australia working on anti gravity and,

440
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:31,790
you know, flying saucers. And he said Keller looked at him very blankly and said, don't know the fellow. He says, oh, that's odd. And he reaches in his coat and pulls out a copy of my book with my photo on it and turns it up in front of Ed Teller. He said the blood drained out of his face and he looked away. And a general over on the side who was in uniform came over and took Teller and said Doctor Tiller's got another meeting and took him away. So I wondered at that point where the Teller was in charge of anything anymore. You see what I'm saying?

441
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:41,280
I do. That's very interesting. I've never been able to get back to the team. It's, you know, I think they did lose whatever, whatever was trying to take him over did.

442
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:50,710
And so anyway, after all of that, Stan had to sort of lay low for a while and he just sort of ended up staying in Australia.

443
01:35:52,030 --> 01:36:06,630
Will Art. I had to give up my US citizenship to keep from being extradited to time that they were trying to to get to the bottom of this. OK, I'd love to be back in this. Were they trying to prosecute you for for anything? I mean, what was? Well, I wasn't sure.

444
01:36:08,710 --> 01:36:12,590
Sorry, sorry. Say again. See, that's a delay we have, all right? My fault.

445
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:22,910
No, just go on it. Just what was the reason? What were you were they trying to renovate you for? There were a number of things, Bob. One of them was that

446
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:40,150
there are a number of things. Oh, geez, can I just put the dog on? She wants to say something here. Just a second. I don't know. The as I said to you, I was doing some undercover work for the FBI and, and they deny, of course, that there were 700 of us doing.

447
01:36:42,800 --> 01:37:06,200
It's a clear dog from Australia. Believe me, it's coming through very clearly. These are the most popular dogs on the planet. They've seen a bird out here and they're trying to eat it. All right. Well, the question, the question is, Stan, were they trying to prosecute you or were there threats on your life? How serious was it? Both when when I went underground, they, they had really determined they going to put me underground permanently in, in Melbourne.

448
01:37:06,950 --> 01:37:30,390
Will we do that? I ran and for a little over a year I, I traveled in the Australian Bush with, you know, let the hair grow out and wore the sunglasses and travel with the hippies and whatever just disappeared. Finally I got hungry and had to come back in. And when I did, I came in under an assume name and worked for a while. And, but eventually they caught up with me because I applied for work in companies and had to show my passport.

449
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:55,630
What was the, can I interrupt you for a second? What was the threat that you presented to him? Were they afraid of the information that you had or so that that was their main concern that you were running around with information that you you could possibly divulge to someone else? And well, first of all, I would be able to identify them. I mean, I could identify, you know, like by name that people were ahead of it in, in the, the

450
01:37:57,440 --> 01:38:05,400
Aeronautical Research Center at Fishman's Bend in Melbourne and in the Australian Club, who of course controlled the prime ministers of this country.

451
01:38:05,870 --> 01:38:24,550
And there was a number of things that I, I was Privy to that would be rather embarrassing. But in their defense, let me say this, now that I've had time to think about it, if I'd have been in their position and they were holding the secrets they were and were under the pressures they were, I would probably have ordered my execution as well.

452
01:38:25,190 --> 01:38:52,750
Umm, it, it's bigger than one person's life. It's a really, I'm sure you would appreciate this, Bob. What we're talking about is a cover up of incredible proportions. Were you able to continue your research or did they have all the requisite hardware? Of course they did. I, I did do something. I, I did play around a bit what I could do, but you know, I couldn't, I didn't have access to high temperature coding. I couldn't put my barium hyphenator anything else on, on, on the capacity of surfaces.

453
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:58,400
But your little that that video you did with the little ship that had the thermionic converter on it.

454
01:38:59,910 --> 01:39:17,430
I don't know why you had to have an element whatever was 1115, because we were quite aware that you could convert thermal energy at around 37 gigahertz on, on the on the sampling frequency. You could, you could take random heat and convert it into flowing electric energy.

455
01:39:19,080 --> 01:39:30,200
Thermionic generator. I mean, yeah, that's it. That's it. Yeah. But all that does, yeah, that's just that's just providing electrical power. That's correct. That's correct. As I said, we didn't need 115 to do that though.

456
01:39:30,350 --> 01:40:00,990
Well, yeah, no one does. I mean, that's how I mean space, space thermionic generators issues, you know, plutonium to warm, essentially A thermocouple using the, you know, see back effect or whatever to produce, you know, electrical energy. However, the the basis of the craft that I worked on, the electrical energy was merely A byproduct. That was not how the entire craft operated. That's where the 115 came in. Now the other thing I noticed here is you're using gravity wave A and gravity wave B focus fields.

457
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:25,990
In the stuff we were working on it, the field we would generate was in a toroidal field that would curl. Well, that's that's exactly how this was generated was essentially in a torrid around the craft. Okay, in fact, there's I just have some some of the animators gave me some fantastic

458
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:27,960
graphics that

459
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:46,880
I haven't really been able to post anywhere. But I did want to put them up on the web somewhere because there are a lot of people that are interested in the actual propagation of the gravity field. And I was just about to give those to the guys that handle our webpage. And you'd be,

460
01:40:47,870 --> 01:41:04,350
it might be worth having a look at that. What's the website? It's look, yeah. Just go to my side and you'll be able to jump right over. Stan, we're out of time in this half hour. But what? From what I've heard, I think that you 2 should be communicating.

461
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:29,470
I know. Well, I never have been able to reach Bob. He kind of did like I did. Went to ground, I think. Yeah. Well, what I'll do is I'll provide Bob with your number in Perth, OK. If with your permission. Is that all right? Fine. Excellent. All right. e-mail might work well too. Yes, it does work well. And we can make those arrangements as well. So. Well, that would be fine. Yeah. I'd like to talk to him. All right, Stan,

462
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:34,680
thank you very much and we'll put you 2 in contact. All right,

463
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:54,720
goodnight. All right, goodnight from America and we'll be right back with Bob Lazar and Gene Huff. This is Coast to Coast and you're listening to Art Bell Somewhere in Time on Premiere radio Networks tonight, an encore presentation of COAST to Coast AM from September 26th, 1997.

464
01:41:54,720 --> 01:42:14,960


465
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:35,160


466
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:55,360


467
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:21,590
Friday night and the lights are low. Radio networks presents heartbells somewhere in time. Tonight's program originally aired September 26th, 1997. Bob Lazar and Gene Huffer, my guests. This is one of the wildest,

468
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:28,160
most believable stories you've ever heard. I wonder if everybody out there understands the significance of what they're hearing.

469
01:43:28,830 --> 01:43:34,390
It's sort of coming out in a matter of fact way, but do you understand the significance of what you're hearing?

470
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,080
I take standale, for example,

471
01:43:39,840 --> 01:44:01,120
very much a religious person, a very devout Christian and very much a truth teller and now Bob Lazar and the same matter of fact kind of delivery. But consider, please consider exactly what you're really hearing this morning, the implications of what you're hearing, what it means.

472
01:44:20,550 --> 01:44:36,350
Gene and Bob, you're both back on the area. It's kind of interesting when you listen to people like Stan and you listen to people like Bob. As far as we've gone with the story, it's all laid out in such a calm, matter of fact way that I think a lot of the public has a tendency to lose sight of

473
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:47,070
the implications of what they're hearing. But you've told the story so many times, Bob, that I guess it comes out that way, sort of in a matter matter of fact way, huh? Yeah, it pretty much does.

474
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:59,320
All right, let us return to your story. Now you're in, you've had a chance to get in the craft, and what are you doing? What are you working on? What are you seeing?

475
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:10,090
If I remember this, I have just met with Barry and we're now going over things.

476
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:22,880
I let's see. Well, this is, as I said when I first realized exactly what was going on, what the implications were, and

477
01:45:24,510 --> 01:45:25,910
precisely what I'd be doing

478
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:35,240
in the room. This is a lab off the main hallway and in the room is

479
01:45:36,310 --> 01:45:42,190
one of the reactors from one of the crafts and one of the amplifiers

480
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:46,350
umm from one of the crafts. Also, how big are these?

481
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:51,000
The reactor I would imagine is about

482
01:45:52,710 --> 01:46:05,470
02 feet somewhere, but around 18 inches, 2 feet somewhere in that general area. Not really big then? No, not not not large at all. Odd looking thing has a bottom plate and then

483
01:46:06,950 --> 01:46:09,110
half of us fear on top of it.

484
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,960
The amplifier itself

485
01:46:16,070 --> 01:46:17,350
is about

486
01:46:18,630 --> 01:46:31,430
again about two feet in diameter, probably 4 feet long, cylindrical, shaped, with something that would look like plates on the outside of it, black in color. I,

487
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:57,910
you know, these are very unusual and essentially hollow, very, very unusual looking devices. This isn't actually the amplifier that I'm always catch myself calling it that. It's the emitter. It's the device that is moved on a pivot, and it's where the gravity wave actually is or emanates from. Quite similar to

488
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:01,960
a horn on a microwave system.

489
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:23,230
Um, you know, as it turns out, the gravity waves behave a lot more like microwaves, at least the gravity waves that are being produced by this system do. So you have wave guides and things of that sort that you see in a microwave system.

490
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:34,120
Those are the main components of the craft that were in the lab at that time. What does that suggest or tell us about the nature of gravity?

491
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:37,850
Well, actually you have to look and see

492
01:47:38,630 --> 01:47:46,070
what we really know about gravity. And, you know, we really, as it turns out, don't know anything about gravity.

493
01:47:49,040 --> 01:48:07,760
As people have said, we can certainly measure its forces or measure its effect on things. But really to to this date, there is no, and a lot of people don't know this, that there is, there is truly no conclusive evidence

494
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:18,270
at the present time that gravitational waves have ever been detected in the laboratory. Now, there have been several gravitational wave detectors built and

495
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:25,470
you can assume that if you're taking gravitational waves, but they can also be detecting

496
01:48:27,670 --> 01:48:30,470
many other energies

497
01:48:32,240 --> 01:48:57,040
or fluxes of energies from who knows where. So it's, it's something we can hardly measure, something we certainly know the existence of, but we know very, very little about it. It's essentially a big hole, a black hole, if you will, in physics as we know it. Actually, the physicists that I've talked to are not altogether certain whether it's a push or a pull. And

498
01:48:57,950 --> 01:49:02,270
the one I think are pretty sure it's it's a poll. But in physics today,

499
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:27,000
it's physics itself is so fluid. Yet so many people, either true physicists or armchair physicists or, you know, scientists, whoever you run into, really stand their ground on on theories. And yet, you know, most people tend to forget that these are just theories. You know they are not

500
01:49:28,260 --> 01:49:43,700
you know, these are not facts. This is a topic we know very, very little about. And as I said some time ago, we or the prominent theory was that there are gravitons, alleged subatomic particles that actually,

501
01:49:44,430 --> 01:49:47,030
you know, accounted for the force of gravity. However,

502
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:50,580
people that do bring that up

503
01:49:51,310 --> 01:50:01,550
really don't know much about that theory either because there was never an actual particle called a graviton. The whole concept behind a graviton was that

504
01:50:03,390 --> 01:50:04,270
because

505
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:13,320
I'm trying to think of how to put this in layman's terms, they basically wanted to

506
01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:16,070
to quantify gravity.

507
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:23,240
Maybe I shouldn't get into this. All right. You're looking at this thing when you see it. Do you know what it is?

508
01:50:24,190 --> 01:50:33,950
What are we talking about? The, well, the, uh, the early last night, OK, we're looking at the, the amplifier. That's right. That's right. Well, we'll say the technical discussion for later then.

509
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:41,440
No, basically I, I have no idea what I'm looking at. OK, You know, I had to be LED through everything.

510
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:47,670
The first demonstration that was presented to me was the actual operation of the reactor.

511
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:55,120
This in itself is nothing short of a miracle. We're dealing with something extremely small,

512
01:50:56,350 --> 01:51:10,350
maybe 2 foot square, maybe 6 inches high just on outside dimensions. And the power output of something like this is equivalent to a little nuclear power plant. I mean, it's very impressive.

513
01:51:12,230 --> 01:51:20,830
Also the fact that it's not producing any waste heat, which is a violation of one of the laws of thermodynamics

514
01:51:22,720 --> 01:51:27,200
to interrupt too much. But didn't you say that that reactor put out as as much power as as Hoover Dam?

515
01:51:28,830 --> 01:51:48,110
I really, I remember I recorded all the data I had about it. But off the top of my head now, I don't remember the reactor the way people like me in the audience. So they can imagine the type of power we're talking about. But it was a huge amount of power coming out of essentially a very small small place.

516
01:51:51,430 --> 01:51:58,430
Was certainly not the electrical output of it, but it was showing me the gravitational field around the device.

517
01:51:58,830 --> 01:52:10,350
Now the only reason I started going off on a tangent about gravity is because I guess my whole point was that we don't have a machine. There is nothing in existence that can make gravity.

518
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:13,270
I've seen a lot of people

519
01:52:13,990 --> 01:52:15,070
just lay people

520
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:24,080
telling me stories about how to watch a film on NASA and how the astronauts are training and they're in a little chamber and they're floating around

521
01:52:24,470 --> 01:52:51,790
and, you know, in a weightless environment. They don't realize it's an airplane doing a crash dive, that there, there there is no machine that makes gravity, I mean, at all. Nobody has that on earth, on Earth, right? And here was a device that in operation was doing this to do that. Barry told me, well, he started the reactor when it was operating. After a short time, he told me to

522
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:53,600
put my hand

523
01:52:54,310 --> 01:53:08,590
or attempt to touch the sphere on the top of the reactor. And as my hand got close to it, you can feel a force exactly like putting 2 light poles of a magnet together, kind of that soft

524
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:24,320
push. Yeah, it's soft push. But you know what? What you're experiencing now is more of an anti gravity field, which is something, you know, something entirely different. That's extremely interesting, Bob, because as you may have seen,

525
01:53:24,710 --> 01:53:33,910
they've done experiments now in Sweden are with incredible magnetic fields generated in a fairly conventional manner and they have actually levitated

526
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:42,520
and plants and all kinds of strange little things they've levitated with. Oh, absolutely.

527
01:53:43,830 --> 01:54:05,790
I haven't heard anything about with a magnetic field. Oh, absolutely, yes. Not magnetic. I wonder what is this just a, a raw magnetic field, An electromagnetic field? An electromagnetic field, Raw and gigantic. And they had a little chamber superconducting setup that they're levitating a frog. You got it.

528
01:54:06,990 --> 01:54:30,870
Is it written up anywhere? Oh absolutely. I wonder how this managed to pass. I'm glad to be delivering so much news to you tonight. Don't but, but obviously where can what? Do you have any? Is it on your website? Run off on a on another tangent here, but is there a name of any of the people or anything you can reference me to where I could look?

529
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:39,920
I'm sorry, this second I can. It was finished scientists. It was carried on NBC, ABC, CBS, all the networks had it. They had the photographs of frogs floating there.

530
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:48,640
Tremendous discovery there. Well, it is it just when you mentioned to me the tremendous gravitational field

531
01:54:49,070 --> 01:55:14,110
and the effect on your biological hand, it immediately flashed to that experiment in Finland. So there you are. Anyway, so you put one more question. Have they levitated anything non conductive, something with no water in it, like just a well, I don't know what a well they they levitated or something like that? No, I don't think so. I think that it was plants, nuts,

532
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:18,760
frogs, spiders, It was all biological material. Yes,

533
01:55:20,070 --> 01:55:29,070
that's yes, but but you said yourself you felt you felt the gravity with your hand. Now that's the biological effect,

534
01:55:29,990 --> 01:55:36,950
right? Anyway, I don't want to stunt your story. I just couldn't resist telling you that. No, I'm glad you brought it up. That's that's actually very, very interesting to me.

535
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:51,160
As time went on, we tossed a little golf ball at it too, and it never did hit this fear. It merely ricocheted off the field, which again was an impressive display.

536
01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:57,240
A golf ball is not in any way conductive.

537
01:55:58,230 --> 01:56:09,470
It has no moisture. It has no well or minimal amounts. Very so minimal aside from the fluid, Sure. Golf balls, oh, that's right, they are fluid centers, aren't they? But

538
01:56:11,390 --> 01:56:19,390
in either case, this was a quite a impressive demonstration just in the fact that this is producing a,

539
01:56:20,150 --> 01:56:24,510
you know, gravitation omnidirectional gravitational field around the unit.

540
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:29,680
It was later connected up to the emitter and the amplifier

541
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:36,800
and where the gravitational beam out of the emitter can be focused.

542
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:41,160
This again was extremely impressive.

543
01:56:43,480 --> 01:56:53,800
The gravitational wave or waves coming out of the emitter were focused into a small point and produced a little black dot

544
01:56:54,430 --> 01:57:10,750
in the air, hovering in the air. Really. Now this is not to say with a black hole, but what it was showing me was that it could bend light. Now the only thing that can bend light is gravity. You know, it's

545
01:57:12,640 --> 01:57:25,360
the only a lot of people say, well, light can be bent so on and so forth. Usually that's diffracted or or refracted. But where you can only bend light is with gravitational waves. So to me, again, this is another impressive demonstration,

546
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:57,030
but it really was a kind of a black hole. Well, in the sense that it was absorbing, at least in the black hole, you know, by definition itself would be the source of the gravitational distortion, as opposed to, you know, this focusing on it. And, you know, you're also, you know, a black hole, quantum singularity and blah, blah, blah. Sure, but the theory is the same, isn't it? In other words, you saw the blackness because of the intense focus of right

547
01:57:58,580 --> 01:58:05,860
was an escape. Yeah, essentially true. Still, I've been extremely impressive demonstration to me.

548
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:07,840
So

549
01:58:09,990 --> 01:58:18,510
basically those were the well there were. We did get to essentially fool around with it a little more, but he was updating me with

550
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:32,480
basically what had been learned in the time that they had the craft there. He wasn't really specific on how long the craft was there. I was very elusive on many of the questions.

551
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:44,270
How many did you? Yeah, that that's something I want to touch on. You must have had a million questions by then. I did. I did. And they he would answer them

552
01:58:46,190 --> 01:58:57,230
peripherally. He wouldn't really get down to the meat of the question. But at that point, Barry had a higher security clients than you did, didn't he? Yeah, that's probably true.

553
01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:04,440
That may have been the reason. Yeah. Who knows if he was told to do that or that was his own decision or,

554
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:06,950
or what, but, umm,

555
01:59:08,830 --> 01:59:28,270
again, he was just basically telling me in with what they know and, uh, what my job was going to be and, and, uh, this was it. This was uh, finding out how this subsystem of the craft operated. It operated in the craft, operated outside of the craft. Could this eventually be duplicated? Uh,

556
01:59:28,390 --> 01:59:51,070
using another power source? Could this power source be duplicated itself without using exotic materials? And so on and so forth. Sometime later, I got my only view inside the craft, which again, was extremely exciting. Yeah, no kidding. Now, can you describe what you saw in that craft?

557
01:59:51,990 --> 01:59:55,190
Yeah, I was led in uh, again by uh,

558
01:59:58,490 --> 02:00:02,530
what's his name? Not Barry, Dennis and um.

559
02:00:05,020 --> 02:00:18,380
We walked up a small roll away stairway that led into the craft. It was very cramped getting in the doorway. the Hatch was removed. I really didn't pay attention

560
02:00:19,150 --> 02:00:24,550
to see how it was fashioned to it or if there were hinges or anything. A lot of people have asked me that, but it was,

561
02:00:26,150 --> 02:00:39,430
you know, you don't spend time looking at how a door was connected somewhere when there's a flying saucer in front of you. In either case, I went inside initially. You must bend over to get in. There is very little

562
02:00:40,430 --> 02:01:09,800
headroom. So whoever originally flew in this was small, right, Whatever fluent it was. And if you notice our if you're looking at the, the model of the sport model there out near the equator of the disk, I mean it literally comes to A to a point and and it graduates as you go towards the center. So obviously the feeling is very low near the edge. And for the benefit of the audience with Internet access, I've got a photograph of the sport model on my live studio Cam right now.

563
02:01:11,240 --> 02:01:13,280
OK, go ahead, Bob. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt

564
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:19,840
as you walk into the craft. First of all, it's

565
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:27,430
I should address a few questions of people constantly ask me. All right, please. One of them is certainly, well,

566
02:01:28,230 --> 02:01:43,510
how did you feel going to the craft? Wasn't it the most exciting thing in your life? And I know I've said this 1000 times before to to many other people, but it was not the feeling at that time was not of excitement. It was a very ominous feeling,

567
02:01:45,240 --> 02:01:47,640
very much so. It was more of feeling like

568
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:58,580
it's actually, I can't, I really can't describe it. It's difficult to put into words, but it was a very ominous feeling. More like, Are you sure we should be here?

569
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:24,400
But of course, after the fact, you know, it was certainly exciting, but it was a very, very odd feeling because it was no pun intended. It was a very unearthly setting inside. All right, That's a perfect place to hook them and hang them up until we come back from the news. So everybody, relax. We'll be right back. All right. Bob Lazar and Gene Huffer, my guests. I'm Art Bell. This is Coast to Coast AM.

570
02:02:25,390 --> 02:02:33,510
You're listening to Art Bells Somewhere in Time, the night featuring a replay of Coast to Coast AM from September 26th, 1997.

571
02:02:46,200 --> 02:02:46,800
Watching me,

572
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:53,760
but then they send me away. Teach me how to be sensible,

573
02:02:55,710 --> 02:03:00,990
logical or responsible, practical and then they show me.

574
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:23,120


575
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:48,430
You're listening to Art Bells Somewhere in Time on Premiere Radio Networks tonight at encore presentation of Coast to Coast AM from September 26th, 1997. Wow. Good morning.

576
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:54,960
This show is obviously going to be a 5 hour program and it's going to be a collector's item.

577
02:03:55,430 --> 02:03:58,310
Believe me, a collectors item so

578
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:11,200
you may have to you can actually begin calling now as we go deeper and deeper and deeper into Mr. Lazarus experience at Area S4.

579
02:04:30,670 --> 02:04:46,030
Art Bell now turns it back to Bob Lazar. And Bob, you're right. I'm sure you know all the questions that people would ask if I started picking up phone lines now. So what about being inside that craft? What do people generally ask and how do you respond?

580
02:04:46,630 --> 02:04:49,670
Well, first of all, the overall description inside

581
02:04:52,080 --> 02:04:53,760
entering the craft is,

582
02:04:55,520 --> 02:04:59,280
like I said, certainly uncomfortable for an adult human being.

583
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:01,680
It's a

584
02:05:04,110 --> 02:05:08,870
you realize that you're not in a place that was designed for humans. Exactly.

585
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:11,760
And it certainly

586
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:19,440
is different from anything that you're familiar with. And what I mean to say about that is

587
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:24,280
everything is basically one color.

588
02:05:25,390 --> 02:05:30,190
Normally any area you're surrounded and is always different textures, different colors,

589
02:05:31,710 --> 02:05:35,230
so on and so forth. The inside of the craft

590
02:05:36,430 --> 02:05:42,590
is essentially all a dull pewter aluminum color, Very metallic looking.

591
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:53,470
There are no sharp right angles anywhere in the description I've given before. Is it basically the crap? Looks like it was just injection molded essentially like the model was.

592
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:56,440
There are no seams anywhere.

593
02:05:58,440 --> 02:06:01,880
Everything inside the craft looks like

594
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:12,480
it was fashioned out of wax, heated for a short time and then cooled to where everything basically melted

595
02:06:12,790 --> 02:06:15,910
into what was next to it, what it was sitting on.

596
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:26,560
That's that's about the best description I can give as to how the inside looked seamless. Seamless and and very unusual.

597
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:31,080
Again, no right angles anywhere. The

598
02:06:32,910 --> 02:06:51,310
structure of the craft, the skin from the outside, was smooth inside. This is very difficult to describe, but if you can picture yourself inside a disk of a flying saucer shape and you're inside looking at the

599
02:06:52,070 --> 02:06:59,390
the wall surrounding you, there was an additional structure, kind of a secondary wall.

600
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:03,200
It was kind of repetitive archways.

601
02:07:05,150 --> 02:07:07,950
That looks like it was either

602
02:07:09,070 --> 02:07:12,750
for a structural integrity or as we later found out,

603
02:07:14,680 --> 02:07:32,080
something to do with the waveguide and the gravity amplifiers themselves. But if you have the box there you're looking at, you notice what I'm saying is kind of difficult. There's a little booklet that came in there that has a nice cutaway view of the craft, but it's it's very difficult to describe

604
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:38,760
without drawing a picture or seeing something visual.

605
02:07:39,110 --> 02:07:53,550
Well, the lucky people on the Internet can see what I'm I'm holding up. The others are going to have to make do with your word pictures or go out and get a copy of the tester model or how else might people see

606
02:07:54,310 --> 02:08:13,670
is, is there something on your? Well, again, it would be your website. So it's just people with computers. So we've got to formulate word pictures for people without. Yeah, I'm not really good at that, but that's basically what the there are three levels to the craft. When you enter, you enter into the main level, and that's basically what you see. As far as what's on the main level,

607
02:08:14,830 --> 02:08:28,990
well, first of all, the dimension of the crab is about 52 feet in diameter, about 16 feet high. That's just the overall measurement. Now, back on the inside of the craft, what you'll see in the center of the craft is the reactor itself.

608
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:45,000
Extending from the reactor up through the top of the craft is the waveguide. It kind of looks like a little chimney, more or less. Surrounding the reactor in the center of the craft are three seats.

609
02:08:45,750 --> 02:08:48,030
These seats all face One Direction.

610
02:08:49,150 --> 02:08:56,030
Also near these three seats are the three gravity amplifiers themselves. They look like consoles,

611
02:08:58,720 --> 02:09:12,760
just solid rectangular objects. There's when I say consoles, I don't mean there's any buttons, lights, or anything of that sort. And in fact, there were no buttons, light switches, or wiring in the entire craft. Really. Really.

612
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:17,600
That's also quite an impressive feat.

613
02:09:20,150 --> 02:09:23,990
No levers, no buttons, no lights, no switches.

614
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:42,760
However, I did not get to go in one part of the craft, so I really can't say what was there, but I do have a good idea as to what was. Now. This was all on the center level. Immediately underneath, there's a small breakaway part of the floor as you walk in

615
02:09:43,830 --> 02:09:50,030
to the craft over to the left. It's a collapse, A collapsible, hexagonal,

616
02:09:51,460 --> 02:09:57,460
very unique doorway. People have asked me, have you ever seen anything

617
02:09:59,880 --> 02:10:04,680
in any of these crafts, any of the technology that could be used

618
02:10:05,990 --> 02:10:09,950
today? Something simple and that's certainly one of them.

619
02:10:11,590 --> 02:10:21,150
Aside from the, you know, high tech gravitational propulsion system, so on and so forth. Something very, very simple to understand and easy. And anyone that's taken

620
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:38,480
A6 pack of beer or bottles or anything like that, you'll notice that if you push on the sides of the you take all the bottles out, you push on the sides of the the box, it all collapses flat. Yes, and the

621
02:10:39,790 --> 02:10:41,910
floor itself with hexagonal

622
02:10:43,270 --> 02:11:00,430
in shape and made of little square hexagons like that of thin metal. The little notch cut out. So basically to operate it you just stuck your hand in the notch and pushed and the entire thing collapsed flat and left a hole open. However, since

623
02:11:01,670 --> 02:11:09,350
when it's I'm getting tangled with my words here trying to because there's so many other things going through my mind

624
02:11:11,270 --> 02:11:35,190
when it's extended and it's the opening is closed off, it's it's a very strong structure because you're standing on the top of hexagons. The metal is relatively thick. Even though it's it's am I, you kind of have an idea of what I'm trying to present here. I have visual, of course. I understand how it drives the strength, yes.

625
02:11:36,120 --> 02:11:43,000
So yes, it's very easy to collapse one way, but that's one simple thing I thought would find uses somewhere somehow,

626
02:11:43,350 --> 02:12:09,710
something that could be made right now. In fact, I've fashioned one of thin metal, have absolutely no use for it. But it it's just one of those strange things. I've never seen anything like it. And it's certainly something that could be, I don't know, used in some sort of architecture somewhere. Now the craft you were in had all of its the generator, the amplifier.

627
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:13,440
This is all on the first level. Everything was intact.

628
02:12:14,230 --> 02:12:20,910
Absolutely. All right, well, let me take that back. One of the amplifiers was removed on this craft.

629
02:12:22,720 --> 02:12:39,600
When you do collapse this little porthole, you can fit your body through at least the upper part of it and look underneath. This is the lower level of the craft. This is where the emitters, what I sometimes call the gravity amplifiers, hang down.

630
02:12:41,680 --> 02:12:43,160
These are three

631
02:12:45,350 --> 02:13:04,750
of the cylindrical shaped black objects, 2 foot diameter, 4 feet long that actually emit gravitational waves from them like a microwave horn, right? They are positioned directly underneath the larger rectangular gravity amplifiers on the first level and are in fact connected to them. The

632
02:13:06,230 --> 02:13:20,270
actual physical connection between the emitters and the sub flooring above it again is something very interesting. It's our short piece of pipe, I'd say. Oh,

633
02:13:21,990 --> 02:13:28,310
maybe 12 inches longer, maybe slightly 12 inches long, maybe a little longer than that. But

634
02:13:30,430 --> 02:13:45,750
this mounting flexes in any direction. But it's a solid piece of pipe. It's something very, very unusual. And we see the same thing being used on the waveguide to the reactor from what we could,

635
02:13:46,790 --> 02:13:53,750
well, from what we could see by applying an electric charge to different parts of this

636
02:13:55,150 --> 02:13:56,950
of the structure would bend

637
02:13:58,720 --> 02:14:11,680
quite easily. Yeah, it's again something very difficult to describe without drawing it exactly how this operated, but it's, it was not made of,

638
02:14:13,710 --> 02:14:41,590
uh, tell us in a telescopic form where you'd see something like a car antenna where it would collapse down on each section, would collapse down on to one another. It was a solid piece, if you can imagine, just a solid piece of pipe and applying electric charge to it and having the pipe bend but remain rigid after it had done so. Anyway, this compromise the OR composed the focusing system for these three amplifiers.

639
02:14:42,520 --> 02:14:45,440
They receive signals from other parts of the craft.

640
02:14:46,430 --> 02:14:54,710
The amplifiers would focus in on a certain point and you know, this is basically how the amplifiers were aimed

641
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:58,040
very and the craft had

642
02:14:59,230 --> 02:15:24,710
again, it's kind of a lengthy explanation, but there were two different modes the craft we found would operate in One is called Omicron and one is called Delta. The Omicron configuration was the standard operating mode of the craft, and it's where it used one single amplifier to maintain its elevation in the Sky. One of the other amplifiers

643
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:29,840
was rotated 90° and essentially pointed straight out ahead of the craft.

644
02:15:31,240 --> 02:15:37,640
So with one amplifier working it essentially produced an anti gravitational pillar to stand on

645
02:15:38,870 --> 02:15:43,910
with the amplifier that was rotated 90° Instead of

646
02:15:44,590 --> 02:15:49,230
what we would normally think along the lines of propulsion

647
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,360
where a jet would essentially

648
02:15:55,580 --> 02:16:11,500
exhaust material hot gases out the back. Where we would normally think along the lines of our propulsion of a propulsive force, what the craft did was essentially create a distortion in front of it,

649
02:16:13,290 --> 02:16:27,570
a distortion. Now a gravitational distortion is, is that like sort of creating a well, in effect? Exactly. It would create a little distortion, a divot in time space if you want to call it that,

650
02:16:29,280 --> 02:16:46,800
as well as a good a good analogy too, to where the craft would actually, this is kind of the low performance mode if you want to give it a name, but where the craft would actually continue slide downhill. Yes, a very awkward, strange motor. For pulsion, we have nothing

651
02:16:48,830 --> 02:17:09,750
that would even really relate to something like that, but it's kind of backwards, if you see what I'm saying. I do the other motor propulsion and you before we go to that, you would imagine this mode of propulsion to be used in in what configuration? In other words, in an atmosphere, for example, in an atmosphere, just

652
02:17:11,210 --> 02:17:34,810
maneuvering around small objects. Source of gravity probably to our planet or moon, would you say? I would imagine so, yeah. I don't think it would be used in space. There would be some. By definition of this motor, it requires some force, some large amount of gravity to be acting on the craft. So you would have to be near some sort of gravitational body,

653
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:40,680
I would imagine, as it was hovering around the ground. This is what would it All right, makes sense. And then there was another mode.

654
02:17:41,470 --> 02:17:56,590
The other mode is the delta configuration, and this is how it normally travels through space and makes large jumps. The craft flies with the belly facing the direction you want to go, not as you would normally see the craft in a science fiction movie.

655
02:17:58,360 --> 02:18:03,520
The gravity amplifiers are all brought up to power, and they're focused on a single point.

656
02:18:05,870 --> 02:18:07,990
This point now becomes

657
02:18:09,680 --> 02:18:35,200
an area of intense gravitational distortion, many, many times more than what we were talking about before. And this is where the the true warp Dr. comes into effect. This is where you actually bend. You begin to distort space and time, and instead of the craft actually flying, you're basically distorting the fabric of space around the craft and and

658
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:41,630
move without actually traveling. You're not. You're not moving.

659
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:53,520
If I'm visualizing this correctly. It's kind of like the other mode, except far more intense and you're you're constantly moving toward this warp or with this warp. I don't know which way to think.

660
02:18:57,960 --> 02:19:04,560
It's a pretty wild concept, but something that it really isn't unknown to us.

661
02:19:05,670 --> 02:19:07,470
As I stated before,

662
02:19:08,270 --> 02:19:36,590
to most people it sounds like wild science fiction. However, we know most of these things are possible. We know, for example, as I stated in that tape, that we can see stars that are behind the sun. And the reason for that is the intense gravitational field of the sun bends not just light, but it bends space around the sun, and we can see some things behind it. We know that

663
02:19:38,110 --> 02:20:02,870
not just we know space, gravity, and time are all interrelated. We know this for a fact. We know that around areas of intense gravitational field, time essentially slows down. I mean, it's certainly been theorized that if one was to orbit a black hole, an area of tremendous gravitational distortion of gravity will, for instance, that time would virtually stop.

664
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:06,560
So with all these things interacting, this is how

665
02:20:07,550 --> 02:20:32,310
you can travel a great distance with essentially no time elapsing. First of all, your bending space towards you. By doing that, you're actually slowing time. Not to say that this is a time machine, it's just a a byproduct. Whenever you, whenever you produce a gravitational field, whenever you're around an intense gravitational field, time slows. It's just

666
02:20:33,120 --> 02:20:39,760
Bob did Bob, did you discern all of this yourself after long examining? Oh, no, this was OK. They gave you this then,

667
02:20:40,190 --> 02:20:40,670
right?

668
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:44,840
All right. And so God, you've got you.

669
02:20:46,670 --> 02:21:14,510
So then you're in the craft. Then your job, I guess is to go back to the gravity amplifier and the rest of it they've already got dissembled and try and back engineer the thing or try to make it work with materials that we have here on earth. Is that correct? Basically? So, well basically is to start at the very beginning and look at the reactor and try and, and try and see how from, from ground level the device operates. And this is where

670
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:16,800
apparently I came in

671
02:21:17,510 --> 02:21:36,910
to the project. All right. And that is where we must pause. Bottom of the hour, Bob Lazar and Gene Huffer, my guests, don't move. You're listening to Art Bell Somewhere in Time on Premiere Radio Networks tonight at Encore presentation of Coast to Coast AM from September 26th, 1997.

672
02:21:38,470 --> 02:21:39,310
Conversation.

673
02:21:44,080 --> 02:21:44,680
She's coming in

674
02:21:47,960 --> 02:21:49,520
reflect the stars that widely told Salvation.

675
02:21:54,520 --> 02:22:01,680
I stopped to know them along the way, hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies.

676
02:22:06,160 --> 02:22:08,920
He turned to me as if to say,

677
02:22:09,790 --> 02:22:11,670
Pray boy, it's waiting for you.

678
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:19,280
Gotta take the last to take me away.

679
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:39,720


680
02:22:49,510 --> 02:23:05,310
You're listening to Art Bells Somewhere in Time, the night featuring a replay of Coast to Coast AM from September 26th, 1997. Tell you what we're going to try to do. We're going to try to get as much of the story out as we can in this next half hour and then we will open up the lines.

681
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,800


682
02:23:24,270 --> 02:23:32,230
Back now to Bob Lazar and Gene Huff. Gene basically the silent one right now, sort of helping out as he can.

683
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:40,160
Let's see Bob, in the interest of time because you know, we could spend 10 hours with this,

684
02:23:41,590 --> 02:24:05,350
perhaps not before you fell asleep, but well, we did make some coffee Here I was. I just think that I started rambling and not saying anything, so hopefully this will help. We are about 3 hours past my bedtime. I see. I appreciate it. The nation appreciates it. This really is an incredible story. Now briefly, you went to work obviously trying to back engineer this. How far did you get what you learn?

685
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:13,920
Well, not very, and I need to digress for a moment here. And this is where I learned one of the reasons why I was hired.

686
02:24:14,350 --> 02:24:24,790
Initially, our work started on the reactor. We figured that's the center point of everything, and this is where we should really concentrate our efforts. And apparently that's what the people before me did too.

687
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:26,390
Apparently

688
02:24:28,120 --> 02:24:44,640
there was an attempt to analyze the operation of one of these reactors, and I got to read the notes that the gentleman before me had left. There was a fatality, or actually 3 fatalities if I remember,

689
02:24:46,630 --> 02:24:56,350
when they attempted to do this. For some reason they attempted to get into the reactor while it was in operation under load, and it was never very clear

690
02:24:56,510 --> 02:24:59,990
in their notes as to why anyone decided to do that. Umm.

691
02:25:02,070 --> 02:25:14,190
However, again, in the interest of time, I'll cut this short. But they did attempt to do that. The reactor did explode and the gentleman were killed. I was to replace one of these people.

692
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:25,320
Did anybody at any point suggest that you go in? Oh, no, no, I think this is something. I think they reached a point of frustration, couldn't get anywhere in,

693
02:25:26,910 --> 02:25:34,190
you know, went on from there. Again, this didn't sound very sensible to me, but this was a story that was related to me

694
02:25:34,270 --> 02:25:45,910
and just something I thought I'd pass along another. Also, let me add one other point too that has really nothing to do with this, but we were also talking about static on the phone

695
02:25:48,430 --> 02:26:03,070
coincidentally earlier today. Now I have no cordless phones in the house. Umm, I was on the phone with Gene and my neighbor comes to the door and tells me that she can hear my conversation on the phone on her cordless phone.

696
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:28,920
I found that kind of hard to believe, so I picked up her cordless phone and listened and could hear everything fine on mine. I mean, that's very unusual to say the least. He he called me and I could literally hear his neighbor talking on a cordless phone in her house from my house. What you need then is a sweep of your house. Absolutely. Well, I called sit and tell and they should be here tomorrow too. But

697
02:26:30,470 --> 02:26:50,390
you know, what an odd coincidence that 10 years ago I certainly haven't had any problems like this for a long time, but it is pretty unusual. Anyway, back to what we were talking. Sure, three who went down before you, three who died. So there you are. What do you do?

698
02:26:51,270 --> 02:26:56,030
Well, basically followed in their footsteps up to that point. What we did find

699
02:26:56,870 --> 02:27:10,550
was that the reactor operated at least the lower part of the reactor. The base plate operated like a little cyclotron, and in fact the first cyclotrons were almost exactly that size.

700
02:27:12,360 --> 02:27:26,600
They accelerated particles to a high speed in a circular fashion along this base plate. The particles were then diverted by electrical and magnetic fields up into a target area, which is what was inside

701
02:27:27,550 --> 02:27:44,790
the domed part of the reactor. These and this is now where we get into some exotic material. One of the elements we identified in the reactor we we then found

702
02:27:48,160 --> 02:28:12,120
well again we had identified an element, an element, a super heavy element, one that doesn't naturally occur on Earth and certainly one that we haven't synthesized. This element was identified as 115. Now normally the higher level elements, the ones that we have produced in accelerators,

703
02:28:12,880 --> 02:28:14,720
decay in a fairly short time.

704
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:23,240
In this case, what we're seeing was a stable element, one that was not undergoing any radioactive decay,

705
02:28:24,590 --> 02:28:41,790
uh, which is very unusual. However, again, this is something that uh, science and chemists have uh, already theorized that there should be an island, essentially an island of stability, uh, for elements

706
02:28:42,870 --> 02:28:49,270
around the 1:14 one 15116 area. However, we certainly haven't been able to

707
02:28:50,550 --> 02:28:57,150
produce anything that that high up on the periodic chart. But apparently, you know, this is what we were observing.

708
02:28:57,310 --> 02:29:07,070
How much of this element 115 was available? 200? Well, there were 223 grams in the craft in the reactor, 223g.

709
02:29:08,860 --> 02:29:25,700
I heard a story, I think it may have been from John Lear that and this jumps us way ahead, but that you somehow got some of element 115 out of that area. Is that true? I really don't want to comment on that.

710
02:29:27,480 --> 02:29:43,080
All right, I didn't think so. John didn't want to say much about it either, but that was that was rumor. We'll we'll we'll let it stand as a rumor. All right. So element 115, something that we don't have yet. I think we have progressed a little bit up the scale,

711
02:29:44,030 --> 02:29:48,230
but we're certainly not at 1:15. Where are we now? What is our? I believe the

712
02:29:49,310 --> 02:29:56,150
the last isolated was one 12112 and most of the more recent,

713
02:29:59,090 --> 02:30:02,890
more recent work has been done in Darmstadt, Germany. All right.

714
02:30:06,240 --> 02:30:08,360
In fact, I believe

715
02:30:09,150 --> 02:30:09,910
there's, umm,

716
02:30:11,930 --> 02:30:16,250
their plan to produce element 116,

717
02:30:17,590 --> 02:30:21,470
uh, is coming up next. I think they plan on

718
02:30:21,860 --> 02:30:47,380
yes, I think they were going to fuse curium with calcium and and they were going to end up with element 116, which they then thought would decay it and chain of unknown nuclides and see where the island of stability actually settled. But they are, they are very close to attempting to, you know, Pierce that island of stability and and seeing what's going to happen. However,

719
02:30:48,110 --> 02:30:52,070
producing one or two atoms of it really isn't going to let them determine,

720
02:30:54,460 --> 02:31:17,260
uh, you know, how the substance is going to react, but at least they're there. They're almost to the point now where they can begin to look at some of these exotic substances right there. There are a lot of people waiting to, to see if they can perform any experiments or find this, uh, you know, gravity a that Bob alludes to. But really when you read, and I'm certainly a layperson, when you read on these, for instance, the website for the

721
02:31:18,150 --> 02:31:21,870
the lab for Heavy Ion Research, research in Dormstadt, Germany,

722
02:31:22,260 --> 02:31:41,940
you can see that they actually detect these atoms when they make them. And getting an atom or two, it doesn't put them anywhere near having a quantity of it that you could hold in your hand and actually study for any macro scale type effect. Bob, how long were you then at S4 doing your work?

723
02:31:43,540 --> 02:31:52,580
It was from December of 88 to April of 89, December of 88 to April of 89.

724
02:31:53,260 --> 02:31:54,020
OK,

725
02:31:57,090 --> 02:32:05,050
went wrong. When did the whole thing begin to go to a sour? And why? Boy, then, there is a long story.

726
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:19,950
OK, the reader's diet. This this story. Reader's Digest version. Yeah, Reader's Digest version of this, which is typically longer than the entire story itself.

727
02:32:24,130 --> 02:32:36,810
Do you want me to tell it? Have you got a shorter version than I do? Well, go ahead. How about this? At what stage of work were you when it began to go bad? Well, very, actually very early.

728
02:32:38,470 --> 02:32:56,590
Well, go ahead Gene, give it a try. Well, you know, Bob had been on an all on call basis and right when he got to the point where he's told you about up to this point, they stopped calling him into work. And and this was very frustrating. He wasn't a fun guy to be around. And what had happened is when he,

729
02:32:57,140 --> 02:33:27,700
as he told you before, he had to sign documents allowing them to monitor his phone and fax and computer and anything that came into his house over a phone line. And to make a long, sad story short, Bob's wife was having an affair. And they found out. And when they gave him his security clearance, they deemed him to be financially stable, emotionally stable, and just generally stable. And so now they knew that he was going to be having some emotional problems, and they stopped calling him. Ultimately, they heard his wife

730
02:33:28,100 --> 02:33:52,700
admit that she had had an affair to her mother over the phone and that and she and she ultimately told Bob and they called him in and yanked his security clearance, saying that he would they deemed him to be a sure candidate for emotional instability and that he could reapply again in six to nine months. So I I've never heard any of this before. You've never heard this? No. Yeah. That's the reason that he lost his clearance. It had nothing to do with him.

731
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:59,910
All right, well, you had signed all these papers, Bob. What motivated you to go public?

732
02:34:01,220 --> 02:34:28,580
I mean, that that's weird in itself. I mean, why did you go public? Surely you had to worry about your life. You had to worry about your career. And I, I don't know whether it's everybody knows, but you were virtually the modern term is erased. Your educational records were erased. A lot of the work you did in New Mexico was erased, saved for one little mistake. I think your name was

733
02:34:29,550 --> 02:34:33,470
and still is recorded in a phone book, isn't it?

734
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:58,020
Right. For the most part, yeah. For the most part, everything was they, what was they missed? A where was that? A phone book? Where that was what was an old phone book in Los Alamos? Los Alamos. However, certainly they they couldn't erase the As I mentioned at the beginning of our conversation, the newspaper article at that time

735
02:34:58,910 --> 02:35:04,910
clearly, clearly stated on the front page of the local Los Alamos newspapers that I was a physicist working.

736
02:35:05,180 --> 02:35:05,700
Yeah. Oh, yes,

737
02:35:07,590 --> 02:35:34,670
you know, they're, they said certainly couldn't go back and make that disappear. They made a lot disappear, didn't they? Yeah. Oh, they're, however art, you know, they they did lie to begin with. As you know, George Knapp for your listeners is the at that point in time was a a news anchor for the CDs affiliate here in Las Vegas. Yes. And he had extensive correspondence with Los Alamos as well as Kirk Meyer, which was

738
02:35:34,980 --> 02:36:04,630
one of the subcontractors that Bob worked for. And they all denied. Kirk Meyer did say he was issued AZ number, which was a number required to be an employee and to get a paycheck. But none of them had said that they retained records that far back. And at this point in time, it was only, you know, 5 or 6 years earlier. It wasn't, you know, 10 years like it is now. And that they didn't retain any records at all. And George gave them numerous. Chances are he said, Are you sure

739
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:29,660
you have no record of Bob Lazar? He has Kirk Meyer. You sure you have no record of Bob Lazar? They denied, deny, denied. And then that's when Bob came up with the Los Alamos phone book with his name and station number in there. And then also he had a copy of the Los Alamos newspaper from 1982. How did they react to that? Well, well, there we're also talking about two people. When I was initially hired on, I was hired on

740
02:36:30,470 --> 02:36:33,910
via a headhunter essentially for Los Alamos. Sure. And I worked,

741
02:36:34,860 --> 02:37:01,580
like I said, the, uh, initial time you work for anyone, uh, in a secure job, you have that, uh, time before your clearance goes through. And that's when I worked for Kirkmeyer, uh, and then later became hired on directly, uh, at Los Alamos. However, both people, uh, you know, either quote, UN quote, lost their records, uh, or just flatly denied

742
02:37:03,030 --> 02:37:03,990
the existence

743
02:37:04,660 --> 02:37:08,700
of me even working there. Well, what pushed you to go public?

744
02:37:10,260 --> 02:37:13,460
What pushed me to go public, essentially, was fear. Umm,

745
02:37:16,270 --> 02:37:27,230
fear of what? Fear of death, fear of prosecution, fear of, well, just fear in general. I, I, I imagine you can add them all together. And that was essentially what I was feeling at the time.

746
02:37:29,500 --> 02:37:32,980
You know, at that time I had nothing other than

747
02:37:33,900 --> 02:37:54,020
what I had said to anybody. For the most part. If I suddenly disappeared off the face of the earth, nobody would have noticed. Well, not only would nobody would have noticed, I certainly have friends and family that would miss me, but no one would have known exactly what happened. And people disappear all the time, especially in Las Vegas.

748
02:37:54,380 --> 02:37:56,220
So I at least wanted to get

749
02:37:57,380 --> 02:38:16,740
what was going on out in the open. And I believe it worked very well. It was essentially A pushback against all the force that was leaning on me, where if I I thought if I just went on in a subdued fashion on television and maybe just said a little bit,

750
02:38:18,550 --> 02:38:28,070
I just can't kind of give a little shove back, they would layoff. And it was perhaps it was a big gamble, but it worked exactly the way I wanted it to.

751
02:38:29,320 --> 02:38:59,320
Also at this point, when he was trying to show those around him what was going on is when he took people like me and his wife and John Lear out to the BLM land outside of Area 51. And we actually saw one of the disks tested in the sky. Now, Bob did this after he after he told us the story, after he was in trouble and in fear for his life, he told those around him the story. And obviously we were a little apprehensive when a friend said, you know, we thought he was just working

752
02:38:59,860 --> 02:39:24,100
and, you know, some project for the government. None of us really cared what he was doing. And, you know, so he wanted to prove that, not that we thought he was lying, but it's still an an outrageous story to tell your wife and friends and say, oh, by the way, I'm working on flying saucers. Sure. And John has told me the story of the trip up Area 51. And there is video to support your claim as well. Right, Right. Plenty of video

753
02:39:25,030 --> 02:39:29,670
when the screenplay that you are now developing that is going to tell this whole story.

754
02:39:30,060 --> 02:40:00,940
Gene, when will this be manifested into something that we can go out and watch at the movies? Well, you know, I don't think Steven Spielberg could tell you that the the fact is the first movie deal literally the president of the studio came to meet Bob and said, I'm going to make this movie. Do you want to help or not? And five years later, that movie still not on the screen. So I would I would not be so bold as to give a date. But these people do seem serious. And if they could wave a magic wand, they'd like to have it on the screen in the in the summer.

755
02:40:01,060 --> 02:40:25,940
Or fall of 1998. But I mean, who knows? Well, the atmosphere for it now after the way the genre has been going has got to be just right. Well, they say that if a mediocre movie like Men in Black and, and we all had hoped Men in Black would be great, but it was kind of mediocre. It did 230 million just here in the United States. So I, I would say that's more than encouraging.

756
02:40:26,790 --> 02:40:29,470
Bob, are you going to you going to act at all in the movie?

757
02:40:30,180 --> 02:40:36,100
Well, but actually I don't want them to make the move. You don't? No, really. Why not?

758
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:51,020
He's already. You really haven't been. He's afraid they'll make it outrageous and won't stick to the storyline. What is the problem? Are you well, no, it's he's probably right, by the way. They will, you know. Well, you have to. When you sign a contract for a movie deal, you have to sign,

759
02:40:51,340 --> 02:40:57,180
you know you have to sign away every, right? I mean, they could turn it into anything they want.

760
02:40:57,300 --> 02:41:08,260
And so Bob has stayed getting close to the vast and and restricts what they can portray. They can't portray any live aliens and oh, I don't know, by the time it's over you have little guys going,

761
02:41:10,070 --> 02:41:14,150
well, not with my name on it. Will be fighting him with a machine gun probably.

762
02:41:16,190 --> 02:41:32,070
Well, it sure has been a pleasure doing this. And we sure did get a lot of good information out. And I want to thank you both. And I I I'm sure you both want to go to bed. We do. Got that right. All right. Have a nice vacation. Alright. Thank you. Goodnight to both of you. OK. All right, That's Bob Lazar and Gene Huff,

763
02:41:32,820 --> 02:41:52,900
and that's one rare interview. One rare interview. So if you want a copy of it, it's bound to be a collector's item. And if you can't get through now because it's going to be jammed, keep trying all weekend long. Well, I'm off to Egypt and Rome and Greece and all that sort of thing, but not until after Dreamland on Sunday. See you then. Goodnight, America.

764
02:41:54,550 --> 02:42:14,990
