We're here for all night talk radio and we have on the telephone

10
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:31,110
our guest for the evening, John Lear. Good morning, everybody. I'm Mark Bell. This is Coast to Coast AM, and we're going to be here from now until 6:00 in the morning with some of the some of the very strangest

11
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:45,120
information that you've ever heard. As a matter of fact, let me give my standard warning so I don't have to put up with the abuse. Later in the show we're going to be talking about unidentified flying objects,

12
00:02:45,630 --> 00:03:10,510
aliens, alien technology, its effect on Earth and a lot more. Some of it at times relating to religion and very sensitive. And my caution to you all, my caveat would be if this kind of thing disturbs or scares you or there's anybody in the room that would be disturbed or scared, please get them out of the room and or turn the radio off for the rest of you.

13
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,920
John Lear, in just a moment

14
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:40,670
right now, I want to tell you about the Sea Crane Company. And the Sea Crane Company is a most unusual company. They ought to be your one stop Christmas shopping store. Here's kind of a partial list of what's available. And this also is a caveat. If they're beginning to sell out, despite how well they stocked up for Christmas, they're beginning to sell out. So if you wait much longer, you may be sorry.

15
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:52,320
It's all going very quickly. The Sea Crane Company has in stock, in limited stock now, the San Gene 818 CS, the best radio in the world,

16
00:03:52,910 --> 00:04:17,510
$250 AM FM shortwave, the complete shortwave band. Nothing more sensitive nor selective on any of the bands than the San Gene. It's an incredible rating. It has a built-in tape deck to record whatever you hear and to play it back it it'll you can set it up with a timer. It's got 42 One Touch memories.

17
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,600
It's a serious radio BFO. You can hear the world. It brings the world to your doorstep. Stock is now beginning to get low

18
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:49,230
$250. They've got the TV, radio, it's about the size of a pack of cigarettes. It gets AM, FM and television of all things, and it's got 19 one touch memories, boom, boom, boom. You just go right through the memories. You can include all the local VHF television stations. You have 6995,

19
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:58,560
they've got the select antenna $50. It'll improve the radio reception of any radio. Just put it next to it, no batteries or wires.

20
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:23,190
Tune it and your radio reception is vastly improved, $50. They've got scanners for police fire emergency reception if you want one of those. They begin at $125.00. It's all at the Sea Crane Company. They'll open between 8:00 AM and probably around one or two or maybe even 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

21
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:33,320
The number to call, and I know it's hard to get through, is 1-800-522-8863,

22
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:41,070
1-800-522-8863. And I was told to warn you this morning, stock is getting low.

23
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,550
And now

24
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:56,430
I'm going to go ahead and read his resume because I want you. I very much want you to know all of you, particularly those of you who have never heard him before. You're in for quite a shock

25
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,390
who you're listening to.

26
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:28,590
John Lear, 4949 years of age, now a captain for a cargo airline, has flown 160 different types of aircraft in over 50 different countries. He held 18 world speed records in the Learjet, including the round the world speed records set in 1966, and is the only pilot to ever have earned and held every Airman certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.

27
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:55,590
These certificates include the airline transport rating, flight instructor, ground instructor, navigator, flight engineer, dispatcher, airframe and power plant mechanic, control tower operator, and parachute rigger. In addition to this, he holds the PATCO Award for Outstanding Airmanship presented in 1968. Lear has flown missions worldwide for the CIA

28
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,280
and other government agencies.

29
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:16,710
He flew in Southeast Asia between 1966 and 1973 and his extensive experience in Europe, the Middle East, Afghanistan, the Far East, Africa, the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is also flown experimental test flights for the Learjet Corporation and other companies.

30
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:43,220
As a non SCAD pilot, he's flown for 28 different airline companies in the past 25 years and has been a pilot for 34 years. Lear studied industrial design in college, then pursued his aviation career flying airplanes, seaplanes, gliders, gyro planes, helicopters, balloons and fighter type aircraft. While attending high school in Switzerland,

31
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:53,920
Lear became the youngest American to climb the Matterhorn in German. In 1968, he pylon raced a Douglas B26 Invader

32
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,910
in the Reno Air Races, the largest aircraft ever raced at Reno at the time.

33
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:07,310
At age 28, he was one of the youngest Boeing 707 captains to fly in commercial airline service.

34
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:26,990
A former Nevada State Senate candidate, John is the son of William P Lear, senior designer of the Learjet Executive Aircraft, the eight track stereo, and founder of Lear Incorporated, now Lear Siegler Corporation. A large defense contractor,

35
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:41,630
Lear has written extensively about airplanes and other subjects and was Middle East correspondent for Combat Illustrated between 1975 and 77 while stationed in Beirut, Lebanon, with a cargo airline.

36
00:08:42,270 --> 00:09:05,230
Although Lear's father was outspoken in his belief of the existence of extraterrestrial visitors to the great concern of the Pentagon, by the way, particularly because Lear senior was head of a large defense contracting company, John only became interested in the subject himself seven years ago after talking with an Air Force pilot who was stationed at Bentwaters Air Force Base near London, England,

37
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,280
where three small aliens were photographed by the Air Force. Actually photographed by the Air Force

38
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:28,990
walking up to Wing Commander General Gordon Williams, Lear's extensive worldwide civilian, military and intelligence contacts have made it easier for him to penetrate the secrecy surrounding the subject of UFOs.

39
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:59,340
Then in 1988, John became acquainted with a government scientist who worked at Area S4, part of the Super secret Area 51 at the Nevada Test Site. The scientist was a member of the most classified government research team then in existence. It was their job to research and try to duplicate the propulsion system of nine recovered alien aircraft in storage at the Nevada Test Site.

40
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,480
Lear is an amateur Astro astronomer and photographer

41
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:15,630
and has won several awards for his photos taken during his worldwide travels. He owned and campaigned the 12m America's Cupboat Soliloquy out of Marina del Rey, CA for two years.

42
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:47,270
He is vice president of the Generals Ward and Chennault post #1, the Soldier of Fortune Post of the American Legion and a member of the Special Operations Association. John currently is chief pilot for a cargo airline flies Boeing 727 throughout the Caribbean and South America. Lear has four daughters, lives in Las Vegas with his wife Merrily, a former actress, and youngest daughter, Jacqueline, 15.

43
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,480
His hobbies include gardening,

44
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,550
carpentry

45
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:57,070
and UFOs. I added the last and

46
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:08,270
so away we go without any further introduction and that just about did it. Here is John Lear. Good morning John Lear, how you doing? Good, good to hear you again,

47
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:21,760
John. There's been an awful lot of stuff going on and that's, that's mainly why I had you back. Beside the general discussion, which we always end up in, there's a whole bunch of stuff I want to ask you about #1

48
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,510
is, is my sighting.

49
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:45,750
Now, I don't know whether you've heard anything about this or not, but I'll tell you, John, I really did see a couple of things that maybe nothing more than, you know, falling something or another's. But on my way in from Pahrump toward Las Vegas, I have now seen in three different times

50
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:57,470
what I, I, I'm, I really don't know what it was, John. It looked, it looked on the one hand a little bit like a falling star. But I've seen falling stars all my life,

51
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:28,110
and this was not typical of a falling star. It was more like I have described it as a green fireball trailing a fire behind it in a trajectory across the sky. It wasn't small. It wasn't like a typical falling star that we've all seen for years. It was. And I'll tell you why I'm mentioning this, John. It's because I set it on the air. And you wouldn't believe the derogatory

52
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,590
mail that I've received. I didn't. I joked around, said it's seed pod or something coming down,

53
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:57,110
but that was just a joke and for having seen this and reported on it. You can't believe the mail that I've received, John and and and so that set me to thinking if that got me that kind of mail and I said at the time could have been a falling star. I don't know, but sure was strange. I can understand what you've gone through.

54
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:05,820
Well, it's been been quite an adventure since I accidentally got into this in 1985. It sure has.

55
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:22,320
I bet. I bet. Do you get, John, quite a quite a bit of abuse of come on, what kind of nut are you? Kind of male? No, as a matter of fact, I don't think I've got very many of those at all, really. One or two in the last, you know, four or five years.

56
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:46,350
Oh, I I got all kinds of out, you know, art to take a vacation. Art work in these late nights must have gotten to you. It's really. But I really did see these things, John. I don't suppose you have any thought or have heard anybody else talk about it. Green fireballs is what they were. It couldn't have been the sheriff's helicopter, right? All on. No, John. Nor was it swamp gas. Here in the desert,

57
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,800
it may have been a gigantic falling star. I, I have no way of knowing, John, but

58
00:13:53,230 --> 00:14:21,190
well, you know, there was a lot of reports in 19, I think it was 484950 in New Mexico of green fireballs. Lots of those. I haven't heard too many recently, but there certainly was back then. I could only describe it as trailing fire and sparks and so on and so on. And sucker was really moving. I mean, it just went across the trajectory in the sky and just, oh, I don't know, four or five seconds. It was really moving.

59
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,680
Oh, there's a lot of strange things flying around. Yes, there are. Out in my valley, John, I see some mighty strange stuff.

60
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:40,030
All right, I watched. I don't suppose you happen to see Sightings last night, did you? No, I forgot to watch what was on Sightings last night. Did a little segment on

61
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:59,960
angels and I hit start in on this so early, but they commissioned the Gallup poll people to do a poll and ask the American people how many by percentage believe in angels. This will surprise you. 65% of the American people, according to

62
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,750
according to Gallup, believe in angels.

63
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:23,230
How about that? Well, it relates in a sense, because if that many people can believe in angels, I would think that also a very, very high percentage could believe that these UFOs are are more than just something unidentified. Wouldn't that make sense? Yeah, I think it would.

64
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,670
OK, I've got a number of other things I want to cover with you.

65
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:52,190
The Associated Press a couple of days ago John reported on a very close call for Earth. At first I thought that it was an old report, but then they began to say, as we slept last night, A2 mile wide asteroid passed within 2 million miles of Earth, which they considered to be

66
00:15:52,950 --> 00:16:15,150
just close within a cosmic blink. And I note that in all of these, and there have been several instances like this lately, John, they always tell us about it after it has passed. Can, John, can you hold on a SEC? We've got to do a break. Stand by. We'll get back to John Lear in just a moment. This is CBC and BRN.

67
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:25,520


68
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:49,870
Good morning, everybody. Welcome back to the best talk radio in the night time from the Great American Southwest. I'm Art Bell with John Lear and we're going to be talking UF OS and other strange things this morning. So back to it we go. And John, John,

69
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:06,280
that was a big rock, I mean, A2 mile wide asteroid that passed right by, probably always tell us right afterwards. I think they happened about six months ago. But yes, it did. Yes, it did. That's what I'm recalling. And it's been a series of these, John,

70
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:26,510
are we just going to sort of not wake up one day, probably be like that? Remember a couple years ago they got Dan Quayle, head of some deal that was supposed to, to look out in space and see if there are any asteroids headed this way. Everybody poo pooed it. I, I recall time. Oh, what a waste of money, they said.

71
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:49,590
But I'm tired of hearing this about all this like a baseball score. You know, it seems to me, aren't we keeping track of these things? Shouldn't we be? Well, it seems so. They're they're certainly a lot of them out there. Well, here's the big $64,000 question, John. Suppose they saw one headed our way that wasn't going to miss.

72
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,710
Would they tell us?

73
00:17:53,190 --> 00:18:05,230
I don't know. Are you got me? That's that's a good question there. Darn, didn't want it to be a good question. Hope there being an answer. I'm worried about that. Anyway, on to some other stuff.

74
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:25,720
Big, big news, John, about Aurora, the Aurora aircraft. A lot of people don't know what that is. What do you know? Well, supposedly Aurora is the supposed name of a man Mach 85000 mile per hour transatmospheric strategic reconnaissance hybrid jet

75
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:53,910
which can supposedly achieve orbit and probably dip into the atmosphere to gather intelligence and then skip back into space to continue its orbit. This aircraft's been seen by several people that I know. Supposedly it may have had a near miss with a 747 back August 4th. A couple of friends of mine were up at the test site last week and heard it. It has a very strange strange sound. It's a very loud,

76
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,560
low pitched roar with a rhythmic beat

77
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:20,790
and sometimes you can hear it around the Groom Lake area. It's very distinctive with a rhythmic beat. Now I understand a little bit about Jet Propulsion or even rocket propulsion. What would give it a rhythmic beat? Now I don't know that much about it either, but I know a few guys that do. Unfortunately, they're listening tonight, but they probably won't call in.

78
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:29,510
Would you urge them to? Yeah. Come on, guys, call in and tell us what makes the rhythmic beep. You know, don't you, John?

79
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:44,000
All right, if if such a person exists out there, we'll let them call on the first time caller line cause line long since locked up here, John. That would be area code 702-385-7213.

80
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,680
Is this Aurora aircraft in your opinion, John, our technology?

81
00:19:52,390 --> 00:20:05,110
No, it's, it's our technology and probably burns liquid hydrogen or or maybe liquid methane is probably air launched by another aircraft and probably made by Lockheed.

82
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:37,030
Aha, I understand that it is triangular in shape. Well, that story comes from somebody who sought, I think working on an oil rig in in the North Sea. And it may be. But the thing that's that's interesting about this story is this guy saw a triangular shaped aircraft either refueling from the C 1:30 or being paced from AC130. And I can assure you that a Mach 8 aircraft could probably not do that.

83
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,430
We don't fly that slow.

84
00:20:42,320 --> 00:21:12,960
We have quite a while before I get to that. One more piece of real hard news here, John. I was listening, coming in to a station I listened to in San Francisco frequently. And they had an expert on who astronomer, I believe, who suggested that indeed our son, and I'm going to leave this as a teaser because I've got to go for another quick break here, but our son has lost 110th of its output, 110th of 1% of its output

85
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:33,640
in the last two months. We'll be right back. If you own a gun or want to have the right to do so, you're right. Good morning, everybody, back to it, back to John Lear. John, once again, I believe this is good hard information. They've measured 110th of 1% of drop in the Suns output in the last two months. Now, I'm not, I'm not an expert on the sun,

86
00:21:33,790 --> 00:22:00,270
but this man appeared to be. And he suggested that was something to keep our eye on, that, you know, the sun is a big nuclear generator and it it does fluctuate, but probably ought not this month this much. Or maybe we ought to send somebody to fix it. Like maybe. God. Yeah. He'd be about the only one, wouldn't he? I, I, I wonder in the end, John, do you think the Earth will

87
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,480
just sort of will go out in a blaze of glory and some big astronomical event,

88
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:19,990
or you will be hit by something, or the people that you know about will have something to do with us, or we'll just go plotting onward? I don't know. All I know is I'm going to have the greenest lawn

89
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:38,120
at the last minute. I've been, I've been really, I should be more perky tonight, but I've been participating in the what's known as the Great Christmas Decoration and Light War in western Las Vegas. I see few people have gotten together there. Their houses are across from each other and

90
00:22:38,470 --> 00:23:04,630
and put more trying to get more lights than the other person. And it's been I got an idea for you to trying to trying to outdo the other. John, I've got an idea for you. Yeah. I mean, it's perfect. Why don't you construct a little wood, a wood frame, saucer and light it sounds good. I think you could actually, you know, have a red and blue light on top and you could have it saucer shaped and I don't know, it would be neat. Anyway,

91
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,400
John, you've got to understand, I know this is old, but a lot of people

92
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:29,950
just have never heard you before and they don't know what it is you think and what it is you believe based on the research you've done. So I don't know where you want to start, but give us a sketch. Well, basically, you heard my resume. I got into this by accident. 1985. I met a friend who had come to Nellis Air Force Base,

93
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:39,960
changing from active Air Force to to National Guard. And this guy had flown with me in Laos

94
00:23:40,310 --> 00:24:07,110
and came over and we talked about old times and asked him where all he'd been based since I'd seen him, which had been like 19721973. And he mentioned bent waters. And most pilots have heard this story of this saucer landing at Bentwaters Air Force Base near London in 1980. So I said, when he said that, I said, oh, that's supposedly where that Foster landed in in 1980. And he said,

95
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:27,520
no, John, not supposedly it did. He said, I didn't see it because I was confined to quarters, but I know the guys who did. And he gave me the names of General Gordon Williams, Major Ted Conrad and Colonel Chuck Hald. And I looked at Greg and I said, what are you talking about? You mean this stuff is real? I there are saucers and aliens. And he said, yeah,

96
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:53,870
So I thought I had known a lot about secret operations, secret government operations. I'd flown quite a few missions and knew a lot of secret things, but I certainly didn't know anything about this. So I started researching it. And in 1987, I, in December, I wrote what became known as the infamous John Lear hypothesis about what was going on. And all it was was

97
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,720
my idea based on the people that I had talked to of essentially what was going on

98
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:17,550
really in the, in the field of disc flying, disc aliens and that. And, and basically that was that in 1964, we had made an official contact with at least with, with 1 alien group and we agreed to exchange

99
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:31,800
to receive technology in exchange for helping them cover up the, the fact of their existence. And that contract has gone along. There's been a few changes,

100
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:56,950
but essentially that's the way it works. And essentially it still exists today in that same form or a modified form. Yeah. Supposedly there are 9 recovered alien craft up at the test site. There's no question about that. There's probably at least one species of aliens that we work with up at the test site. There's no question in my mind that that that's going on

101
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,000
9 recovered craft.

102
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:26,630
John, can do you know whether we have applied any of this knowledge of alien technology? Do you can you point to any applications? No, I can't think of anything that we've applied to. There's a lot of rumors that it was, you know, applied to the 117 stealth fighter and stuff. But I don't really see anything that as far as the technology that we could have gotten,

103
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,800
how it could be applied to the B2 or the, OR the F117 I, that's all straight technology.

104
00:26:35,270 --> 00:27:03,030
Why, why is this still under wraps? Well, I guess you answered that question, didn't you? Because we promised to keep it that way. Well, we promised to keep it that way. And there's a lot of religious, well, the religious aspect to this, it would upset a great many people. They'd want a lot of questions. There's no way that the government could come out and say, look, we we have recovered an alien spacecraft. We have talked to aliens,

105
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:09,920
but that's all we're going to tell you. They'd want to know more. They want to know the history of mankind where we came from and

106
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:38,870
essentially we're just an experiment and the government believes and and rightfully so. I think that that most of the people can't handle that. Now there there are a few that could say oh that's you know, really neat and continue on existence. I used to think that not true John that the American public was prepared to handle it. But I have come to the conclusion, after having done a number of shows with you, that it just ain't so. That's correct because enough of the percentage of the people

107
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,440
are particularly religious. Folks are so offended and downright angry

108
00:27:44,710 --> 00:28:10,270
that you just have to imagine the total chaos would downright angry that you would even suggest something like that. And so it's better just not to open Pandora's box at all. Not even to open it or crack. And that's why the government is ridiculous as they sound when, when you have a saucer 3 times the size of an aircraft carrier flying alongside a, a cargo 747

109
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,840
for 45 minutes, you know, telling the public it's planet Venus, because they probably rather believe that,

110
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:41,350
umm, how, how do they keep getting away with this? John, I could sometimes wonder about that. You hear about what sounds like a documented bedrock solid sighting, you know, by somebody like yourself with many years flying. And inevitably the government, or some arm of the government, issues a perfectly ridiculous explanation that seems to quiet everything down.

111
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,520
I think it's mankind's infinite capacity to to be bamboozled.

112
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:57,390
All right, I'm going to again jump away for justice a moment, John. I'm going to be asking you, though, when I come back. There is news about a black hole.

113
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:07,320
A scientist apparently have confirmed the existence, or as close as they're able to, of a rather large black hole. And we'll be back with that in a moment.

114
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:12,310
You're listening to the CBC and VRN radio networks.

115
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:34,600
We're going, we're going on the trip of a lifetime. Wouldn't you like to come along? It's it's one of the most unusual cruises that anybody would ever have an opportunity to even sign up for. It's a trans canal cruise. We're going through the Panama Canal

116
00:29:35,550 --> 00:30:01,950
and on the way we'll be stopping in some pretty exotic locations. It all begins San Juan, PR. Actually, it all begins April 17th, I should tell you. San Juan PR, Saint Thomas, the US Virgins, Martinique, Grenada, Caracas, Venezuela, Curacao. Then we transit the canal a full day through the locks and then we're back at sea and up to Acapulco, Mexico. It is

117
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:28,670
a jewel of a cruise. Maybe even you might even want to call it a star, a star. The star Princess is the ship, but it's going to be a star of a cruise. And they don't do this very frequently. So we thought we would offer you in in the way of a cruise this time, something that would provide memories for the rest of your life. That it will do. Come along with us, won't you please?

118
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,880
We have, oh, probably 1000 pieces of literature out there now.

119
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,830
Those of you who have requested it

120
00:30:37,990 --> 00:31:03,550
need to get your deposits in quickly because it's beginning to book quickly. It is urgent now that you get your deposit in if you want to come along on this incredible journey. For those of you that don't have the information yet, you had better call this morning. Here's the number. It's 1-800-638-1066. You can call it right now 1800

121
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,160
6381066 or here in Las Vegas. Good times Travel that represents

122
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:37,510
the incredibly efficient Princess Cruise Lines. That's how I thought of them on the trip. 878-8900, 878-8900 and back now to John Lear. John, for the first time, as I was saying, they apparently have confirmed or as much as they're able, the existence of a black hole now that the black hole is that hole into which at least

123
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:53,320
$100 billion worth of defense budget is dumped. And the opening for this hole is in the center of the Nevada Test Site. It's called Area 51. I know all about that. Yeah. So I'll that that probably qualifies as a one that's even more documentable.

124
00:31:53,630 --> 00:32:24,270
But they actually have discovered this black hole. And I was just wondering, not that you probably would know, but I was asked earlier tonight if you could get through it, what is likely on the other side of a black hole? John, are you talking to the wrong guy? I know about aliens and and flying saucers. But if you want to talk about black holes, you're going to have to talk about to the expert who in my opinion, would be Bob Lazar. It'd be nice if he'd call in and and tell us a little bit about the black hole. Maybe he will. I'd like to hear from John

125
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:29,110
and I got a fax from somebody that asked about

126
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:53,800
Mr. Lazar. And so I guess I should take this opportunity to ask you to go ahead and tell the story briefly, if you would, of Mr. Lazar, because it's an odd one. Well, in 1988, I had given a couple of lectures at the, the library here and, and several people were calling. One who called was a real estate appraiser named Gene Huff and he wanted,

127
00:32:54,630 --> 00:33:13,590
uh, some tapes, uh, of that I had. And, uh, I said, OK, come on up. And, and he came up with a friend of his who was a young scientist who didn't believe at all in, in flying saucers and anything. As a matter of fact, he thought we were nuts then and and he thinks I'm nuts now. But

128
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:23,120
we had a, a friendship that lasted. Oh, I hope it still lasts until now, but

129
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:54,070
about four months. We gave him some information about all about different things and kind of generally changed his opinion on on sauces. He had worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratories. He had a very high clearance. He knew a lot of things that were going on, but he didn't believe anything in this UFO stuff until we pointed out a number of things. One, that Project Grudge still existed. He was able to confirm that with the persons that he knew

130
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:14,070
at the classified library at Los Alamos. OK Project Grudge, I believe, is a project that endeavors to what just it's. It's a collection of reports of sightings and it was supposedly cancelled by the Air Force in 1949 in favor Project Blue Book, but in fact, it still continued. But

131
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:42,990
anyway, he was able to document that yes, some of this stuff was true. So because he was so well schooled, he had at least 2° masters degrees, both of which were, I believe from MIT. And because he had very powerful friends, namely Dr. Teller, he was able to get a job at EG and G local, or at least be interviewed by EG and G here in Las Vegas and get a job up at the

132
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,760
Nevada Test Site, specifically S4 where they kept these saucers.

133
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,270
And I'll never forget the night that he first came,

134
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:19,720
came to my house. It was December 6th, 1988. He sat down and I'm right now some checks. And he says, John, I saw a disc today. And I said, what? And he said, I saw a disc. And I said, bears are ours. And he said bears. And I said, oh, my gosh, did you go to the test site? And he said, yeah. And I said, well, you know, what are you doing here? I don't jeopardize your clearance, you know, to find out what's going on. And then tell us what

135
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:44,150
now he says you've taken a lot of Flack over this. And I wanted to tell you that I saw it. It's all true. I know what the state of the technology is. It's not ours. It came from somewhere else. And that was about it. He worked up there for about four months until one night he invited us out to look at one of the test site or one of the test lights. And this was like April 6th of 1989.

136
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:50,320
We were on legal, we were legally on BLM land watching this thing, but

137
00:35:51,030 --> 00:36:00,510
we got caught by security guards up there who harassed us for a little while. And The upshot of the thing was that they called him in the next day and,

138
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,360
and he decided not to go back to work.

139
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:33,430
And, well, then, of course, there's a bit more as I recall, that man and all trace of him, his educational background, his life disappeared. Yeah. He went on TV and he he told what he'd seen. He was completely honest about what what he had seen up there. And in order to check him out, Channel 8 to George Knapp and Bob Stoldow did some

140
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:44,360
checks and it seemed like everything had disappeared about his background. His birth certificate had disappeared. Any record of his birth is all his degrees

141
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:56,630
from the various colleges had disappeared. There was absolutely no way to prove who he was. And so it was a little bit hard to prove that, you know, who he was and, and what he had done.

142
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:28,320
Uh, there's a fellow named Dwayne John who sent me a fax and there are a number of questions. I'm going to keep referring to them. Some of them are pretty good. He works for Hewlett-Packard, by the way, and he wants, he, he said, Gulf Breeze. If it is a hoax, then why hasn't anyone exposed it as a fraud? He said, I'm not talking about the Ed Walters thing. I'm talking about the sites that take place every two to three days or so in the sky there.

143
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:54,350
Again, why is the news media been kept very quiet about it and wanted you to respond to that? Well, I don't think they've kept quiet. I think all the three networks have been down there and gotten film. But you know, you can just take so much film of lights in the sky. They're they're obviously strange, but there's no way you can prove their extraterrestrial. I believe they are there. I believe the Ed Walter story, there's a lot of people who've tried to discredit him, but

144
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:13,520
there's an answer for for all their arguments that they're brought up. But oddly enough, nothing's been happening down in Gulf Breeze for about the last six months, unless it's just started happening in the past few weeks. All right. I remember, John, an NBC report one night, I think it was Connie Chung, and it may have been in Tokyo

145
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:45,590
and they only showed it once and they would never show it again despite a lot of requests. But by golly, there was a saucer, something in the sky behind Connie Chung. I think it was Connie Chung the reporter. And do you recall hearing any, anything about that? I don't remember that specific one, but there have occasionally been reports like that, but you don't usually see it on the major networks in a news format. You usually see it on the shows like Slidings and Unsolved Mysteries and that type of stuff. All right, what,

146
00:38:45,710 --> 00:39:11,230
John? No, I it goes on in the facts about the daily visit of a UFO in Mexico City. It's been going on for a couple of years now and the only TV show to air this has been sightings. What gives? Does he know why the news media has been kept quiet about this one? I don't think again, I don't think the news media is is kept quiet that there's certainly a lot of film. Where it started is about 6 months ago there was an eclipse of the sun

147
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,000
that could be viewed by Mexico City and it just happened. Everybody had his video camera out

148
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:48,350
filming the eclipse of the sun. Well, for some reason there happened to be a lot of flying saucers out and they got tremendous shots of these things. There was over 100 videotapes collected by Lee Elders who went down there and and started contacting everybody that had them. He worked with the essentially the Mike Wallace of the 60 minutes of of Mexico and they collected his product back and put it on sightings. But as far as the major networks, you know,

149
00:39:48,470 --> 00:40:18,470
you want him to do say, you know, here's a flying saucer. It's been seen in Mexico City, you know, Well, you know what I, I do? In other words, the major networks have never really dealt with this subject seriously. They always do it with a little smile or a chuckle or something. There's never been a good network level investigation of all this. There was one we both recall, but I did. I only viewed it as kind of mediocre. They've really never done a hard news look at this story.

150
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:24,870
Not the same thing that they don't want to do a hard look at AIDS. So you don't want to know what the truth is.

151
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:30,650
That's tantalizing. Do you know what the in fact, John,

152
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:46,640
you've had a long life working at times for the CIA. Now the investigations you've been doing in these areas, how much stuff is there that you know that you flat can't talk about?

153
00:40:47,990 --> 00:41:18,150
I talk about most of it. I talked about quite a bit of it. I've noticed since you've gotten such a wide audience that you've kind of tapered us off in your beliefs. Are you used to be kind of almost to the point of where you believe that, you know, what we were talking about was real. And then, you know, lately in the past few months or so, you take a little occasional shot at, you know, at me and and UFOs and so on. So when I do, John is

154
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:44,230
try and stay balanced. And that's really hard to do in the sense that I don't close my mind to it. Only a fool would do that. There are too many sightings. There's too much apparent evidence. But without seeing one myself really seeing one, or without having evidence I can put my hands on, I cannot come to the point. You know, I get people who call me John and they want to say it's also obvious.

155
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,920
How can you not state that you believe in it? And other people will call and say, how can why can't you go on the air and just say that's all a bunch of trash and garbage.

156
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:57,150
And I can't get to either extreme, John, without some kind of

157
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:18,630
some kind of personal experience. For instance, you know, you talked about the the October Surprise and you made a comment a few weeks ago when they absolutely, you know, put the final nail in the thing and said we're not going to investigate it anymore. John, hold on. We'll come right back to this. Hold on. I want to talk about that. Stay right there.

158
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:33,150
From Jackie Gongs Plaza downtown, this is KDWN Las Vegas.

159
00:42:46,880 --> 00:43:00,040
Good morning again from the Great American Southwest. I'm Art Bell and this is Coast to Coast AM with John Lear this morning. Back to him right away. I want to pick up on this, John, the October Surprise.

160
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:31,920
You and I have had some talks about some things regarding the Octobers fries that we still can't talk about, can we? Yeah, it's, it just sounded to me like a couple weeks or a couple months ago when they when the Senate decided not to pursue it any farther. You said, well, that proves that there's nothing to that. And we both know that yes, there was something to the October Surprise. I participated in in the October Surprise to the extent that I was supposed to fly the the, the guns and ammunition from

161
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:44,870
Tel Aviv to Tehran. I'm surprised you're Aaron this now. Why have you decided to go public on this? You've never asked me. You know, there's no I at the time we discussed it, you said

162
00:43:46,600 --> 00:44:00,960
the Camp Pierre, because there was in case of a Senate investigation. Now my attorney said, you know, don't say anything to anybody. But since it's a bad issue now, I can certainly say, well, maybe it was a dead issue now that you said this,

163
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:32,470
no, they're not going to open it up again. You don't think so? But anyway, the fact is, is that I knew about that part. And there's also strong evidence that that Bush, certainly the last time he was seen was at dinner on on the Saturday that this all occurred, that he was supposed to be in Paris. He flew in a back 111, which is a large private jet over to Paris, completed his meetings with those people and then was flown back in an SR71. It certainly didn't have to be Aurora as long as everybody. Yeah, I

164
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:52,790
the other morning I did say John, but you know, they all said he couldn't have done it or well, certainly the Aurora or even I suppose the a lesser aircraft could have accomplished it. The pilot that flew him back started to talk about this about two years ago and he was put in jail and he's still there. Well, what makes you think you're going to be free to make your lawn green if you

165
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:02,960
so tell? So for the record, John, let's let's get this out again. Your participation in

166
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:12,630
in the October surprise was what was to take the guns and ammunition that was promised to the Khomeini by the

167
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:42,440
by Bush in Casey. It was to go to Tehran. The Mossad was handling and briefing the flights. It was to originate in Tel Aviv. We had to go through Turkey to get there. And so the deal with Turkey was for it to give us overfly rights that they got every other load. How far, How far have you actually gone with it, John? You were in an aircraft in standby, weren't you? So we were briefed, but the first airplane in got shot down. It was an Argentinian CL 44.

168
00:45:43,110 --> 00:46:13,790
And the Mossad couldn't figure out exactly why he'd gotten shot and down because he actually crashed about 40 miles South of Eurovan in Russia. And they supposed what they, what they supposed to happen is he was on his way out. He didn't have any. He'd already dropped his load. And so he apparently the Soviets came down, intercepted him and he thought, well, well, I'll go along with him. They can't prove anything and then shot him down when they got him over Russia. But they couldn't prove it one way or the other.

169
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:41,670
They didn't want to risk the 707 which I was flying. So they they went another way. And it's my understanding I didn't participate in the other one. But I my understanding they went through Dubai, which would just cross the Persian Gulf in the Turin. And you're pretty confident that because they have officially closed this, which was my reference the other day, that they will not upon hearing what you've just said, reopen it or they'll be cries to reopen it? No, I don't think so, because they have to let

170
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,320
Russ Bucker testify, and he's the SR71 pilot that brought him back,

171
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:58,230
and they just don't want to get into it. Wow. Well, we just killed one hour dead, John. So stand by, relax, get some coffee or whatever, and we'll come back and do another. OK. All right, Stay right there.

172
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:29,590
And that that the same thing applies with with UFOs, which I have never seen. Anyway, we'll get back to it in in just a moment. You're listening to the CBC and BRN radio networks. The perfect gift is flowers. And I'm going to tell you why because you don't have to go down to the mall and find 800-257-3825. That's 1800,

173
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,800
257-3825.

174
00:47:34,550 --> 00:48:05,150
And now back to John Lear. John, here we are again. I'm sure you heard what I had to say at the top of the hour. And it is kind of that way. John, I, I'm, I just am not an absolute believer nor a disbeliever. My mind is open. I am impressed with the number of sightings and the things that we've talked about. In fact, it's frightening. But without hands on, you can't make that final. Or I can't, I should say, make that final step, that leap to yes, they exist,

175
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:30,750
but you can't. You have, haven't you? Oh, absolutely. But if you'd have walked in my shoes for the last five years and had access to all the information I had, you probably believed as I do. Yeah. All right, so they are real. What are they, John? That's what a lot of people want to know that haven't listened before. What are the creatures that are in these flying things? Well, I used to say that there was

176
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:37,240
80 different species visiting us. There's probably more. There's there's certainly more than that out in the universe.

177
00:48:37,910 --> 00:49:05,350
And there's all different kinds. There's these little Gray people that do the abductions. There's one that ones that look just like us. And there's also, you know, some awfully weird ones. There's just about any, any ones that you can imagine. What are they? What do they want? Well, supposedly, at least according to the documents that were read by Bob Lazar at the test site. We are an experiment.

178
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,840
We were genetically

179
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:35,470
changed, genetically experimented with. They made I think 65 separate corrections to make us what we are now, which is containers. They refer to us as containers. What we contain wasn't specified in the documents. You can speculate it might be sold, it might be blood, it might be enzymes, but in any case, the, the aliens refer to us as containers and, and they made these containers.

180
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,760
Now, according to the documents he read,

181
00:49:40,110 --> 00:50:08,870
they also engineered the world's major religions. And they did that in an effort to organize and pacify. They created the miracles so that we would believe in an entity, so we would, you know, not go off and rape and murder and pillage and that kind of stuff. We were given the 10 commandments to live by, mainly so that they could organize and pass by and keep us all going in the in the same general direction.

182
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:12,310
They are our creators, supposedly.

183
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:24,240
Are you? Is that one of those things you're certain about, or does that hang in the air more? Is it theory, John? Well, it's, it's looking more and more correct. Who knows what the truth is,

184
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:47,120
what I want to do. I want to start taking a few calls, John, and we'll kind of hopscotch our way through the night here. A lot of people that want to talk to you and I, I should service some of these blinking lines. So let us sporadically begin doing that. Good morning. On the first time caller line, you're on the air Coast to Coast AM with John Leonard Bell.

185
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:56,070
Hello. Yes, I'm here. Good. Where are you? Washington State. In the state of Washington. OK. You're on the air with John Lear.

186
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:22,260
Yes, Mr. Larry, do you believe that there may possibly be some sort of an invasion where they are taking over phone lines, flashing messages over televisions and so forth? Do you believe this can be a possibility? All right. Thank you. That would be pretty open operation, wouldn't it, John? Yeah, If the government itself wasn't doing that, certainly the alien could probably be doing it.

187
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:29,950
Boy, I got I got a funny fax the other day. John, listen to a little bit of this.

188
00:51:31,150 --> 00:52:01,430
If you use a modem, you are monitored. Every time you fire up a modem, you activate automatic monitoring equipment. I work for a large telephone network that routinely monitors modem and fax transmissions. They view whatever is transmitted, even encrypted data. Your government allows this under the heading Maintenance Monitoring. In the FCC rules, monitoring can continue for six months without legal procedure. The rules are part of an obscure pre World War 2 action by the FC C

189
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:08,990
predecessor agency saying no information may be encoded or transmitted over public or private forms

190
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:16,000
of of telephone or radio, with the exception of government agencies involved in national security.

191
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:46,020
So they, they monitor fax and modem transmissions. Our government monitors all of this stuff. Well, I was told the other day that not only that, but they they can monitor your house through your cable for your TV. I had a friend who worked for a cable company. He said it was very highly sophisticated. He stopped short of saying that they could actually watch you, but they can certainly monitor you through the cable TV.

192
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,240
This comes, by the way, from a fellow ham radio operator who works for a,

193
00:52:52,470 --> 00:53:18,110
a company that does this kind of work up in the Bay Area. So he knows what he's talking about. And I guess just about everything is certainly is monitored. Have you ever been concerned about that, John, on a personal basis? Certainly if I were in the government, I think I would monitor John Lear very carefully. No, I don't worry about it because I know it goes on in 1987, just after my

194
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,680
series of lectures here and I appeared on TVA couple times.

195
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:54,710
I have a couple of teenagers here. And the centel guy was up here putting in some phones and he came in one morning and said, hey John, do you know your, your phones tapped? And I said, really? And he said, do you want me to find out where? And I, I said, yeah, So he went out and he came back about 1/2 an hour later. And this guy said, you know, I went behind your house up to the pole and I went over to Monroe St. and then down to Hollywood Blvd. and then down to Nellis and down to Bonanza. And he says it's further than that. He said, I'll be back in a little while. I want to, I want to check what's going on.

196
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:59,350
So he didn't come back until the next morning. And when he came back, he said, John,

197
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:25,360
I can't talk to you anymore. And I said, what are you talking about? He said, I'm not going to be on another route. He said, what happened is I got traced to your phone, tap to the mainframe at Centel. And he said, I went to the FBI and the lady there said that if I didn't like my job, I could quit. He said, So I went home last night, thought about it. I went into work this morning and that same lady was walking out of my boss's office

198
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:46,510
and said the same thing to me. So they made it very clear that if I made any noise that that I wouldn't have my job. And I know who the guy is. He's still, I know where he works. And couple of the other centel guys often come by and say so and so says to say hello to you. So God, John, that's creepy. But it's not a surprise. There's no question in my mind that, that we're monitored.

199
00:54:50,360 --> 00:55:09,280
I, I guess then your attitude just becomes, who cares? You, you know, I'm, I'm above board and I'm going to just keep doing what I'm doing. Or does it intimidate you to know that, Doesn't it? Everything's on the up and up. I'd like to expose some of this stuff that's going on. I I don't think a lot of it is, is, is right,

200
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:32,270
but it doesn't seem like we can do much about it. Wild card line three. You're on the air. Coast to coast AM with our fellow and John Layer. Good morning. Oh, good morning, Art. Where are you calling from, Sir? I'm calling from Mesa. Mesa, AZ, Arizona. All right. I'd like to ask him if it would surprise him to know that Clintons mother's maiden name was Rockefeller

201
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:39,590
and that his real name is William Jefferson Blythe, the 4th

202
00:55:41,030 --> 00:56:12,510
life, life, the Fort. So all of that a surprise to you, John? No, I think what he's saying is, is everybody's connected that goes in the government and we we think that we're getting somebody new. But really the president of the United States is just a figurehead. He really doesn't doesn't make any difference who's in there. The same people who run in the secret government are going to run it no matter who gets it. You know, funny thing, there was a day when I would have catcalled over something like that. But I have come to believe that this last election,

203
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:27,950
it had been Bush for another 4 or Clinton for his first four. It just didn't make much difference in terms of policy or anything else. And I've come to believe that Skull and Bones Trilateral Commission CFR, the whole thing is no different.

204
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:56,900
Does that answer your question, caller? I would like to know the spelling of the pilot's name and where you think he's located. What prison? All right, thank you. John. What can you tell us? Russ Parker, RUSSBACHER. And if you'll listen in a little while, I'll come through some papers here. I looked for it just before when you when you brought that up to, to get that paper that I have. But he'll listen later. I'll, I'll wrestle around for the address where he can be contacted.

205
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:04,200
John is on a tour. She's the one that is trying to get him free, and she's the one that's doing all the public speaking on his behalf.

206
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:19,880
Wow, John, is there anything that we could do on Earth or we might do that would cause these aliens to come out of their invisible closet and intervene in some way in the course of events here?

207
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:40,200
No, I don't intervene in in what sense? Well, suppose for example, tensions were increasing and it looked as those immediate was going to push the button despite the Cold War now being gone. Ha ha. In other words, we're on the edge of self eradication or something of that magnitude.

208
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:57,930
I've heard stories, you know, unsubstantiated that they have in several cases either changed the firing mechanism or changed the the place where something was supposed to land and different rockets. But I don't know whether that's really true or not,

209
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:18,950
or if some astronomical catastrophe began to be apparent. I'm just wondering if if the architects of all of us would intervene and prevent such an occurrence, or they would just view that as the end of the experiment. Well, they might be getting ready just to clean out the Petri dish themselves anyway.

210
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:28,310
And Justice, why, that's a good place to hold it. John, we're at a break. Stand by. I'm going to think that one over. Good morning, everybody.

211
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,800
You're listening to the CBC and VRN radio networks. I'm Art Bell with John Lear.

212
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:45,430
From Jackie Gonz Plaza downtown, this is KDWN Las Vegas.

213
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:13,440
Good morning again from Las Vegas. I'm Art Bell with John Lear, son of Bill Lear, creator of the eight track tape deck, the Lear Executive Jet aircraft.

214
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:21,790
And John has some strong views in many areas, including aliens, UFOs and

215
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:53,670
I guess our political course in this country as well. And back now to John. John, exactly why are we developing the Aurora aircraft? And you know, the exact same question that you just asked was asked by Senator Robert Byrd, who's the chairman of the Senate House Appropriations Committee Committee. And he went to the deputy Secretary of Defense and said, hey, what is that airplane that goes Mach 8? We don't we don't see anything in the in the budgets. Now Senator Byrne is 1 of 16 people who is allowed to see everything in black budget.

216
00:59:53,790 --> 01:00:20,270
So he said, I don't remember signing anything on. There's nothing under there. So they had another some other questions too. NBC April 20th ran a story about Sazerac objects over Groom Light. Channel 13 has some strange lights that they photographed over Groom Lake Aviation Week. May 11th and August 24th had pictures of strange contrails. You know, there was those sky quakes in Southern California. Wall Street Journal comes out with a story.

217
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:31,480
All these things seem to say that there was something strange going on. So the Senate, so Bird sent out a guy to Las Vegas here last Saturday. **** D'amato, senior legislative aide

218
01:00:31,990 --> 01:01:02,550
and he was going to make a surprise trip to Groom Wake. And he told us that, you know, if there was stuff going on and it wasn't through the normal budget that in his words, he was going to pull the plug on Area 51. So he goes up there on Monday to, to Groom Lake to, to tour around and see if any of that stuff is there that we are saying is there, namely Aurora S4, the discount at S4, the the new unfunded secret airport called Sandia next to

219
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:17,870
Piu Mesa. And he went up to Groom Lake. As fate would have it, it was snowed in that day. And they told him that that they couldn't take him anywhere because of the snow. He said he wanted to go down to S4. And they said, oh, you've been talking to that Bob Lazar guy, huh?

220
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:45,800
So apparently he's going to go back in two weeks. And they said that they would take him down there in two weeks, but they wouldn't find anything that they told him that they that there was nothing there. So I imagine two weeks will give him enough time to move stuff out and there won't be anything there in two weeks. I don't have anything against black budgets or anything against secret projects. But when you consider the American taxpayer is footing the bill for these operations and all likelihood is paying two or three times the real cost

221
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:55,710
for the legal budget programs to support the black budget programs, you know, you might want to know who the enemy is that we're really preparing to fight. Well, that was the nature of my question.

222
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,840
What do we need this aircraft for? We have met the enemy and he is

223
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:10,800
in the sense that with a well defined understandable enemy or not. We're going to keep doing this

224
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:27,470
a wild card line three you're on the air coast to coast AM with our phone John Lear Good morning, good morning. I'm Linda from Oregon, and I would like to ask John if he has a herd of L Fletcher Prouty. And

225
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:44,760
he was one of the four people that made-up the composite Mr. X in the movie in JFK that Oliver Stone made, Correct? And I really got an enlightenment about Vietnam and why

226
01:02:45,310 --> 01:03:06,990
Vietnam happened. Yeah. I also, Fletcher Proddy wrote a book about 20 years ago called The Secret Team, and he's just recently written another one that elaborates on that. There's also a book out that you'd be interested in called The Man Who Knew Too Much. It's about 850 pages and it really goes detailed into the Kennedy assassination.

227
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:33,150
I see. Is this, does this also deal with the CIA and the master planners of the world? Yes, it does. Not so much the master planners, but the the part that the CIA, the FBI and everybody else had in the assassination of President Kennedy. And it's called The Man Who Knew Too Much by Rowdy. No, Fletcher Crowdy's book is different. The Man Who Knew Too Much is a separate book,

228
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:39,440
and that's by whom? I'm not sure of the author, but it's it's just come out. You won't have any trouble finding it.

229
01:03:40,150 --> 01:04:11,710
Well, I'm I'm. I really appreciate getting through and getting your response on that because I found it so credible that this man seemed to have such knowledge. And I and I'm just so glad to hear your views on it. And I thank you. All right, Yeah, priority is one of the good guys. All right, Thank you, ma'am. Appreciate your call. John. I I'm going to seek you. I'm going to ask you to comment on kind of a general topic here. One of the good guys. You said the UFO community, and it's pretty large. There are a lot of people

230
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:21,630
lecture, you're probably one of the most respected, maybe king of the heap, and there is an unbelievable amount of dissension

231
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:44,280
in among UFO ologists or why? What's going on here? Why is there so much dissension? Is it the other day they had gone to their first UFO conference and they thought everybody would be more or less generally aligned. But it's it's it's not the case. There is a lot of different views, different access to grind.

232
01:04:45,270 --> 01:05:13,510
We have the Bill Coopers who are really out on on, well, one end and the Linda House who were out on the other end and the rest of us that, you know, trying to bring some sensible sense to the thing. And it's it's just difficult to do. Everybody has a different different acts to cry. I've noticed that every time two people don't agree, the standard thing seems to be to accuse the other guy of being a CIA disinformation

233
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:28,880
operative audience. The standard, standard modus operandi. In other words, if you don't agree with me, you've got to be CIA. This has to be a disinformation. And boy, these charges and counter charges just fly in the magazines, don't they?

234
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:30,190
The way it works.

235
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:51,040
All right, let's take some more calls. Good morning. On the first time caller line, you're on the Air Coast Coast and with our phone. John Leer, good morning. Good morning. Where are you calling from? Susanville. Susanville. All right, turn your radio off and go ahead. John's right here. OK. How you doing, John? Doing pretty good. How you doing? Very well. Twice I got in

236
01:05:53,270 --> 01:05:56,750
my comments, John is you were talking about

237
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,320
how the

238
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:04,310
how to explain the things got difficult.

239
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:33,760
I'm thinking in the Christian thinking is if this thing came out the way that you're talking all the Christians are a good percentage of the Christians would probably have a second thought about Christ and that is the reason that the government is kind of holding this back is that the way you're trying to explain it. Well, that's correct. But when you say all the Christians, you know, you, you think you're talking about a lot of people. Remember, there's

240
01:06:34,350 --> 01:06:39,830
6 billion people on this planet and you know, 5 billion of them are waiting for Jesus to come back.

241
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:42,110
Gap. Well,

242
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:55,230
how about the idea of maybe Satan's who is supposed to be running this world prior to Jesus returning, drumming up this infatuation?

243
01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:00,690
Well, is there a Satan?

244
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:28,550
Well, is there Jesus Christ, you know, you look on both aspects and the ways the Bible reads, I think, is that Satan's supposed to be running this world until Jesus Christ returns. And maybe this is the big ploy that Satan is playing. Well, that, that could be, as art knows, I try to stay out of the religious aspect of this because I just, I stick to nuts and bolts. You know, if you want to talk about gravity amplifiers and

245
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:41,120
and antimatter reactors, that's what I like to talk about. But I, I, I kind of steer clear of the religious aspects. Well, I'm open minded myself. I believe in Jesus Christ, but I still

246
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:43,150
am open minded to these

247
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:47,920
UFOs and what have you. But

248
01:07:50,280 --> 01:08:01,200
all stand by here and and looking a little bit more of this program or watching on television is what I'm doing through satellite. So I appreciate the call. All right. All right, Sir, we appreciate your call. Thank you very much.

249
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:30,390
It is it is inevitable that people want to mix the religious aspect into it somehow. And there there really is a mix. It's just that when we get down to talking about it, it really gets a lot of people angry, which is exactly why exactly why the government won't release all this in, in information, isn't it exactly. It's tough to talk about. It irritates a lot of people. A lot of people have grown up with that belief and, and

250
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:38,040
they really believe it and, and it just could cause a lot of problems. So I you can see their point of view of not opening the door in the first place.

251
01:08:38,590 --> 01:09:08,120
You were correct that 5 billion people are not waiting for Christ to return. Of that billion, quite a significant number of them are here in this country and it would disturb them greatly. All right, let's take one more quick break here. John, stand by a SEC. You're listening to John Lear on the CBC and BRN Radio network. And again I say, if this is all going to disturb you, then turn it off. Don't keep listening to see how disturbed you can really get.

252
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:34,750
Just go ahead and turn it off because we're going to get into some pretty sensitive areas. Would like to talk to you all for a moment about once again, the watch that you've really got to have. It is the Art Bell and Ross Perot watch and it's only $24.95 + 4 dollars shipping. It's so cheap. I When we first started advertising these things, I thought,

253
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:42,520
you know, it cannot be Rossborough must be subsidizing these. But I've subsequently found out it certainly is not true.

254
01:09:42,870 --> 01:10:09,270
It still would be curious to know how the Robert Sanders Company can do it. They produce the original presidential, uh, series of wrist watches and they're continuing to do it. And I don't know what it says that they are producing A Rossborough 96 watch. Perhaps they'd rather think that he'll be back, as do I. Then they decided to produce an Art Bellwatch and coincidentally and fortunately, they're both available for Christmas.

255
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:34,630
So if you want to put your hands on one, here comes the phone number. All you've got to do is 249544 dollars shipping and handling Gold plated. Really very, very nice. In the case of my watch, it's got a dark background against the gold. It's very pretty. Number to call 1-800-257-3825, 1-800-257-3825

256
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:46,840
Back now with you, John. I wanted to correct this statement that I made that I think I entered, Bernard Lee said. The aliens created man. They didn't. They genetically altered A2 legged

257
01:10:47,670 --> 01:11:00,750
human form that was on the earth at that time and that's what the 64 corrections were made from. They didn't create him from from the beginning. Then our ancestor, ancestors I

258
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:34,310
are some other sort of space creature that was modified genetically into whatever we are right now. Oh, whatever was here. It's my understanding they genetically altered whatever it was here. There is, I believe turning to reality or a hard documentable reality. There is a missing link. There is a period of time and they just cannot calculate how mankind made the jump, made the leap, how the intelligent aspect of man was. And there is

259
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:41,390
that in in hard science. There is that that areas that are not. John. Yeah. It's tough to believe

260
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:47,840
when you figure out what the odds are either. There's two general beliefs that we evolved from

261
01:11:49,920 --> 01:12:10,000
matter that fell out of a, you know, out of a common landed in the sea and then he started off with his slime and then something crawled up on the beach and we eventually evolved from that. I mean, there's, there's only that we know of in 18 billion years, the the greatest odds that you can think of wouldn't a permitted man to to have genetically

262
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:38,390
come from that kind of a sequence of events. The other is that the man was made out of clay. So you can, you can pick those or as Gene Huff says, you can be an externalist and believe that we were modified by an external factor. All right, this brings me to something else then, John. All of these abductions, these cattle mutilations, if it, it kind of gives

263
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:43,480
credibility to what you've said because if we are in effect an experiment,

264
01:12:43,950 --> 01:13:14,070
surely those conducting the experiment would from time to time need information to continue the experiment or decide not to Heaven help us. And so then would that would that be the reason for the abduction? Inevitably they talk about medical exams. They were examined medically, John, right. That that might be the very reason for these abductions. All of the abductions are are kind of a medical exam. They they put something here and put something there and sometimes it's painful, sometimes it's not. But but that would

265
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:19,750
we're checking to see how their experiment is going and whether it's time to clean out the Petri dish or not.

266
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:28,310
All right, wild card line three, you're on the air Coast to coast AM with John Leonard, Bell High. Good morning,

267
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:56,200
John. I'm not being personally argumentative. It's just that I have a set of ideas too. And I'm I kind of think it's challenging to think this way because we all want answers. But how would you explain near death experience? And that would be my first question. Secondly, you say not to turn it into religion. I've never been religious per se. Like I don't go to church and I don't believe in that,

268
01:13:56,830 --> 01:14:21,430
but I have a very strong sense of a God figure from any other reason. And having been an atheist when I was young, read a lot of books by people who gave me better answers than a Bible as far as factually could man create God or God create man. And and I'm a real strong believer, OK in a in a beginning and a creator.

269
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,680
I would say that as far as they go,

270
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:32,670
I don't say they're not real. I've never explained even on our Bell show, my experience with it.

271
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:56,800
There have been some. All right, we're going to have to hold it there. Listen on the radio. We'll get you an answer. It is an interesting area, John, this business of near death or death experiences of, you know, the bright light and the whole bit. So many have had it. John, any any thoughts on the matter of my personal opinion that the soul goes on forever and ever

272
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:23,310
and that when you depart this body, there is a short time when, when you can see down and see what's going on before you go to wherever it is we go. Now reincarnation was something that Jesus taught, but at the first meeting of Nikah I think, which was in 325AD, and then there was also a meeting in Constantinople about in 1200 AD,

273
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:29,320
they modified the what we call the King James Version of the Bible and they took a lot. As a matter of fact,

274
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:38,230
they really took about 95% of what Jesus taught out of there. One of the things they took out was the idea of reincarnation.

275
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:49,840
I do personally believe in that and I believe the soul goes on and on and on. So that's the, the, the answer or or what I think the answer is to the near death experiences.

276
01:15:52,080 --> 01:16:00,880
OK, this is going to get into the area that I was afraid of, but I can't resist. Containers. Vessels. That's what we are. Possibly

277
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:16,030
containers or vessels for the human soul that we're now talking about, possibly in experiments with the soul. What, John? Pure speculation. Do you suppose our creators,

278
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:45,310
our alien scientists that have created us, what use would they have for the human soul? Oh, I don't know. Apparently there's a a lot of interest by one species, the Greys, in emotions. And they, they take a lot of time to apparently talk to the abductees about emotions. I've heard of experiments they do

279
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:47,680
with people

280
01:16:48,150 --> 01:17:18,630
to create emotions. For instance, there was a case down in Florida where a guy was abducted and he was put in a long curving corridor with two children and down one end is bizarre. This may sound, here comes a fire beating, breathing dragon. So he turns around, runs the other way and there's a door. He goes into the door and there's a barrel. And his decision was, does he put one

281
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:45,550
in each barrel and and let the dragon eat him, or does he get in the one barrel himself and try and fit the other two in there or, or what? And this was one of the experiments and I don't remember how it came out, but this is one of the experiments they do in trying to either understand or experiment wield emotions. So then you might conclude that emotions, anger, jealousy, all the strong ones,

282
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,360
have some

283
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:51,670
some some value to them.

284
01:17:52,550 --> 01:18:12,390
Possibly. Yeah. Or they are themselves some sort of energy that can be used in some way. Well, apparently, at least according to the abductees, the, the the Greys don't understand it. They don't have emotions themselves, at least like we do. And they're trying to understand the emotions as we feel them. Wow,

285
01:18:13,390 --> 01:18:39,230
wow. Well, we're plotting a lot of new territory this morning. It's very, very interesting. Let's pick up another call quickly. Wild card line three, you're on the air Coast to coast AM with John Leonard Bell High. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Art. I have two quick questions and I'll listen to him. Off the air #1 what these these are people that have been abducted by aliens and been experimented on.

286
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:46,760
Have they ever suffered I'll effects when they get back to earth from the medical experiences? Second question,

287
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:58,990
has John Lear ever known many Navy aviators and has he ever had a desire or has he ever landed on an aircraft carrier? And I'll hang up and listen,

288
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:03,790
John, the first one was about abductees and what was the question And

289
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:36,630
oh, the experience. It's any other, you know, first of all, I don't think they leave Earth. Some of them go maybe a short ways out, but most of them is done relatively close here. Yes, they do suffer I'll effects. Some of them are quite traumatized by the experience. That's why they form these encounter groups where they can talk to to others who have had the same experience. But Hopkins is quite active in in those type of groups where they try to help people who have been traumatized by this. Oh, right. John, did you see the one on sightings

290
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:59,150
have the returning red marks on his belly? No, but I've heard about that case, Pat, or one similar to it. Yeah, let's talk little bit about that. I've got a break coming up, so stand by John. Naval aviators question because I want to answer that. All right, all right, we'll get back to that one too. You're listening to the CBC and BRN radio networks in the night time again with John Lear.

301
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:57,510
Good morning again from Las Vegas. You're listening to the CBC and BRN networks. I'm Mark Bell with John Lear, and we're going to continue through the night with some pretty strange stuff. And you're frightened by all this sort of thing.

302
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:03,360
Turn your radio off. Don't expose yourself to something that would be harmful to you personally.

303
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:08,790
For the rest of you with strong constitutions, let's continue.

304
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:16,030
Good morning again, John. Let's cover what we were going to. We'll get to the naval aviators,

305
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:28,520
but the lasting effects and I was telling you about the fellow with the returning red marks that I think was on sightings of very convincing case. How many people have physical effects that endure?

306
01:24:29,790 --> 01:24:37,670
Well, I don't know what you mean in percentage wise. Well, I mean, how many of you ever heard of I? You've looked into so many of these cases, you'd know more.

307
01:24:37,750 --> 01:25:02,310
Lots, lots. They all have a little, that little scoop that's taken out as far as the physical thing, a little scoop, little scoop of skin that's taken out and they have a mark on their ankle or their leg or or their arm or something. They're told that it's they're just taking genetic materials back to wherever they come from. Interestingly, our own government

308
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:10,000
has recently announced that it has begun a program of gathering first on the military and then probably others.

309
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:13,910
Blood samples for genetic recording.

310
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:46,190
Yeah. So where that were you? Yes, I was naval aviators. Have you ever landed on an aircraft carrier? First of all, he asked if I ever knew any, and I said my answer is yes. I was taught by an evil aviator out of First how to fly. He was a transport pilot. His name was Hal Herman. He used to live in Montague, CA. I don't know whether he's still there or not, but I've known a lot of Navy pilots. Have I landed on a carrier? No. But to me, that would be the most exciting experience

311
01:25:47,110 --> 01:26:15,270
to land on a carrier with 100 and 1/4 visibility on a pitching deck at night. That would be the epitome of airmanship. And I know that there's a lot of guys that have done it. Would you endeavor to do it if you have the chance? Yeah. Well, I certainly need a lot more training than I have now. But. But that really takes airmanship, is to land those jets on the pitching deck at night in extremely low visibility. Yeah, John, I'm told.

312
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:21,200
Is that what that what you have just described is one of the most terrifying things any pilot can ever do

313
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:46,990
you can imagine because, you know, they don't have all that much fuel. It's not like they can say, well, if I miss, you know, I'll just go back to shore. You know, sometimes they're quite a ways from shore. You know, that's their that's their only chance. All right, very quickly. We're short on time this hour. Wild card line three, you're on the air. Coast to coast AM with our phone. John Lehren. Not a lot of time. Go ahead. Right. This is San Diego. Castillo. Yes, Sir. Yeah. Mr. Lear? Yes,

314
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:54,200
about the antimatter reactor, yes. No, I saw I bought the Bob Lazar video and

315
01:26:55,350 --> 01:27:00,590
the last party goes heat is taken in by the thermal electric

316
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:28,000
generator. So that means that the gravitational system is electricity. Is that what they used to? The thermal electric generator is separate. That's what provides a positive vote for the operation of the trip. What the tape didn't describe and what the next one will describe is how the gravity wave works. And basically the gravity B wave forms like an electrostatic charge on the top

317
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:54,310
of the antimatter reactor, and it's channeled and amplified through the wave guides down to the gravity amplifiers. And that's what's used to, to make the pull the space towards you. All right, caller, we're out of time this hour, so I've got a scoot. I guess there'll be yet another tape that will explain all this. John, we've got a break for just a few minutes for the news, and we'll be right back. OK, Stay right there.

318
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:58,480

from Jackie Gonz Plaza downtown. This is KDWN Las Vegas

324
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:52,560
AP Network news. Good morning. I'm Tim, Sergeant. The East Coast still feeling the effects of one of the wettest and windiest storms to hit the area in decades. Sergeant John McCluskey with the New York Police Department says they have a variety of problems to deal with today.

325
01:29:52,950 --> 01:30:06,350
Basically a lot of flood damage in the ocean, lying areas on the coastal part of the city. There was other flood damage to vehicles that had driven into parts of roads where floating had occurred.

326
01:30:07,670 --> 01:30:19,070
And while the storm is moving off the coast now, officials say a high tide of three feet above normal this morning could cause more flooding. Coast Guard Petty Officer in Boston says it's just a normal day for his department.

327
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:40,400
Always on call and on the ready, You know, making sure that our stations, you know, the boats are secured and everything like that. And then help out in the local communities. This is what we've done yesterday, you know, making sure all the boats and the harbors are secured and helping fishermen move their boats to secure areas and sheltered areas.

328
01:30:40,910 --> 01:31:11,270
Conditions yesterday prompted evacuations in the. Virginia's Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey were up to 4 inches of rain fell in the southern part of the state. Authorities say that since Thursday, at least 12 deaths have been blamed on the storms. At least 50 people have been killed in a strong earthquake in eastern Indonesia. Experts at the US Geological Survey say the quake measured 7.5 in the Richter scale. No reports of damage yet, but officials say it may have been extensive because of the quake size and location. Another day in Somalia, another effort to get relief to

329
01:31:11,350 --> 01:31:41,990
people who need it. The APS Karen Sloan reports. Protected by light armored vehicles, armed Humvees and three helicopters buzzing overhead, the first Marine guarded food convoy has traveled from the port to the needy northern area of Somalia's capital. It's only 20 tons of rice, oil and beans, much smaller than aid agencies are used to moving. Some care officials contemptuously referred to it as a convoy. Yet UN and World Food Program officials noted just a test of the new way things will be done now that the milit

330
01:31:42,110 --> 01:32:09,230
here and everyone agrees this first post Marine landing food convoy is symbolic. Karen Sloan, AP Network news Mogadishu, Somalia A federal judge has in Washington has thrown out one of the Iran Contra charges against former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger. The judge says Weinberger cannot be tried on account that alleges he lied to Congress about the affair. Hogan says the charges violate A5 year statute of limitations. This is AP network news.

331
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:35,830
president-elect Bill Clinton wants to turn up the heat on what was Yugoslavia. The AP Thermal Abrecht has details. The president-elect is reiterating his support for the use of US warplanes in the former Yugoslavia republics. Britain and France, which have peacekeeping forces in the region, had been resisting a new show of force. But Bill Clinton says he believes they're moving to modify their position. Anything we can do to turn up the heat a little there to try to reduce the carnage

332
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:43,720
is worth trying. As for the US military's effort to get food aid to the storm in in Somalia, Christian says they're making progress.

333
01:32:43,950 --> 01:33:10,750
But he adds, any decision to expand the US role as the United Nations wants should be up to Bush administration officials and he doesn't want to be second guessing them. Family, Brett. AP network news with the president-elect in Little Rock. More announcements of cabinet appointments expected from Little Rock today. The word now is the Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown will be tapped to be the next commerce secretary. Benign people Clinton has chosen so far, including four women. All are white.

334
01:33:13,120 --> 01:33:31,560
A royal wedding today, but a low key wedding correspondent Joseph White in London says Princess Anne is once again tying the knot. This is not your typical royal wedding. The order of service, the guest list, the site of the honeymoon, all a well kept secret. Royal watcher Allison Hardy says even the mode of transport is a mystery.

335
01:33:32,310 --> 01:34:00,230
Questions. People aren't sure whether they're good to turn up in a Range Rover or whether they're going to go for the more traditional approach in a carriage. I think we'll probably be in someone that moves really quickly. I don't think you'll get a lot of chance to have a look at them. The wedding itself is taking place in Scotland because the Church of England forbids divorced people remarrying in the church. This is 42 year old Princess Anne second marriage. The groom is 37 year Old Navy commander Timothy Lawrence. Also, rumor has it the recently separated Princess of Wales has decided to skip her sister-in-law.

336
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:05,790
63810661800,

337
01:34:06,590 --> 01:34:34,990
638-1066 or Good Times Travel. The agent here for Princess Cruise Lines. Love boat it is, you know. Can be reached at 878-8900. 878-8900 And back we go to John Lear. John, good morning again. Alright, How you doing? You up for a few phone calls? Oh, you bet. All right. Good morning. On the first time Caller line. You're on the air. Coast to coast AM with Art Bell and John Lear.

338
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:51,990
Hi, I have two quick questions for Mr. leer #1A little while ago you said we might start seeing something in about 6 months. And second of all, when is your next speaking engagement? All right, you want to take that on the air right here.

339
01:34:54,240 --> 01:35:07,160
What what was that? What did I say about six months? Something that he well, OK, we'll, we'll go ahead and take, take have him take it on the air. He said that at one time you would stated you thought that perhaps something would become apparent

340
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:17,950
to the American people in about 6 months or something would start happening. Well, like a German interviewer told me the other day on a great researcher about a terrible prophet,

341
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:48,150
you were interviewed by the German press. Is that correct? Yeah, there was a guy in here and very interesting guy. As far as my next speaking engagement, I you know, I only give about two a year and I don't have one plan. All right, I want to take a few local calls here, John. Let's see, line one. You're on the air, coast to coast AM with John Lear and Art Bell. Good morning. Hi. I live here in Las Vegas, Right. And one morning at 9:00, my son and I were going out to take the trash out and

342
01:35:48,550 --> 01:36:08,830
over a junior high school on the western side of town, we saw an object that was somewhat triangular and hovering, and it hovered for 39 minutes. It changed its attitude a number of times. It shined bright lights on us and it changed its color a couple of times.

343
01:36:10,290 --> 01:36:33,490
It went up, it went down, it went diagonal back again. We watched it for a long time. I had two radio towers, 2 airplane towers on the I had two phone lines in the house. And these fellows could. I wish I could see it. They wanted to see it. They couldn't, but. And I could see North Las Vegas tower from my home. I told this story to a couple of people,

344
01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:40,110
02 of which were in the Air Force, and they both cautioned me never to tell the story to anyone again.

345
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:47,560
What was the date of that? That was about four years ago. And what size was it approximately?

346
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:50,800
And twice as big as the

347
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,400
step. Yeah, It went from silver to white.

348
01:36:56,510 --> 01:37:21,830
It changed color. My portable phone went dead and I ended up on the regular phone. It was it wasn't scary. It was fascinating. Yeah. A lot of that happens around the Las Vegas area. And they can fix it so that only the one that they want to see can see it and and you can even be in a crowd and the rest of the people won't see it. You're saying, well, what do you mean you can't see it? It's right there. I don't like that.

349
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:27,480
I don't like that. I don't like that either. And let's ask about that. Thank you, ma'am.

350
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:36,470
John, any, any explanation for the kind of technology that I don't know how they do that, some sort of

351
01:37:38,360 --> 01:38:02,600
hypnosis, mass hypnosis or you know who? Who I guess could guess anyway, you don't know. Okay, good morning. First time caller line. You're on the air with Art Bell and John Lear in Las Vegas. Yeah, I'd like to ask John Lear if he's familiar with Zachariah Sitchin and any, any of his writings regarding the Sumerian tablets. Yeah, I read most his books and he's got some real good ideas.

352
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,440
He's, he's probably on to a lot of good things there.

353
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:28,670
And I just wondered how your, your research has, you know, if it ties in with any of his things or or not. Well, both of it, most of it ties right in. He had a particularly interesting one called The 12 Planet and there's some very interesting aspects of that should be back around soon. I don't know. When did he say it was coming back?

354
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,680
Now I'm not too sure about that. Yeah,

355
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:49,270
no, he has a real, real interesting set of books there. I would recommend that to to anybody who is interested in his. His research shows that there's been visitation from other planets since, you know, back in those days. And

356
01:38:51,110 --> 01:39:09,990
could you kind of confirm that? No, no question about it. He has some very good evidence that there's been all kinds of wars and monkeying around with the human race and modifying this and modifying that. Very good books. Okay, well, thank you very much. Thank you for the call, John. AIDS,

357
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:16,760
AIDS. AIDS. Looks like it's gonna end up taking an awful lot of people out,

358
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,640
John. And I guess it is your view that

359
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:23,680
AIDS which is a unique

360
01:39:25,110 --> 01:39:31,150
genetic bonder of cells. I mean so unique as to almost be impossible. You would think

361
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:37,360
engineered. Engineered my humans engineered by aliens. Purpose. What do you know?

362
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:44,350
Well, it's my personal opinion that it was engineered by the government, specifically the US government

363
01:39:46,160 --> 01:40:04,600
that it was specifically wasn't, no, it wasn't an accidental release. It was specific. It was first released in Africa and I think 1975 through the smallpox vaccine that was, that was laced with the AIDS virus. And then it was released in the United States, I think in 1978.

364
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:26,950
Uh, they specifically wanted to infect a large number of people, but I don't know why. And and that's just opinion, all right. Pretty dark opinion. Pretty awful to imagine our own government would have done that to us and the world. Purpose unknown population reduction possibly, Joe. Well, when you say population reduction,

365
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:39,400
it seems that they want to infect people, but it would, it would certainly seem that there would be a, a, a better, a faster way of getting rid of large numbers of people.

366
01:40:39,550 --> 01:41:06,030
We would suppose they did affect infect everybody in the next 5 years. AIDS doesn't kill immediately. It takes one to 10 years. And you would certainly overtax the hospital's ability to respond to so many people long before you'd be seeing a number of deaths. It's an awfully good point. Right. First time caller line, you're on the air, coast to coast and with John Leonard Bell High. Yes, Art, thank you very much.

367
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:13,280
Let me give you a short story. I'm a somewhat of a theologian and a amateur ufologist.

368
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:40,910
Do you find yourself in conflict? Well, that's an interesting question. Actually, no, I studied the Bible profusely. I was one of the original Jesus people and you know, used to go to bed at night with the Bible on record and, and I I find so many things being explained to me now by recent phenomena and people like John Lear.

369
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:45,920
And of course there are as many questions as there are questions answered.

370
01:41:46,630 --> 01:41:47,030
But,

371
01:41:48,760 --> 01:42:04,120
you know, the, the human mind is a phenomenal creation. And I, you know, in addition to being somewhat of a theologian and a Ufologist, I'm also an optimist. I do believe in the in the the reality of Jesus Christ.

372
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:25,350
And of course, not to dwell on the religious aspect, but I do believe that the book of Revelations is now being opened and revealed to us. And the amazing things that came across in that will be revealed to us now as it said that they would be sealed until the last days.

373
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:30,750
And I have a couple questions. Let me get to him. Yeah, OK.

374
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,720
I, I, I just came across some recent

375
01:42:38,720 --> 01:42:56,080
writings on the Pleiades, the constellation of Pleiades, and there seems to be a lot of the tie INS with that and, and to get a little far out, the lost city of Atlanta.

376
01:42:57,670 --> 01:43:20,870
Umm, and also I'm curious about what your opinion is of the Billy Meyer experience. I'll hang up and just listen to those three things. Billy Meyer play 80s in Atlantis. When I first got into this, what they call euphology, I found out that to be accepted by the the mainstream, you had to

377
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:29,040
disregard Billy Myers, Adamski, George Danske, Howard Menger and and various contactees.

378
01:43:29,630 --> 01:43:55,150
But when I started really looking into it, all those guys were telling the truth. Billy Myers. I even went on TV and I said it was a fraud. And, and six months later, I had to come back and say, hey, wait a minute, I've looked at this thing. I cannot find anybody who can tell me why it's a fraud. On the other hand, I can look at the moving pictures and say that looks, that looks real. And here are the interviews with Billy Myers and say, yes,

379
01:43:56,040 --> 01:44:02,480
yes, that did happen. I can't explain it. I don't know who they are. They say they come from the Pleiades. I have no reason to believe they didn't.

380
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:12,150
So yes, I believe that the Billy Myers case is a true case, and that would probably answer your question of the Pleiades. They certainly fit into

381
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:22,240
this question. How? I don't know exactly. And then the the third question was kind of thing. Art, do you remember

382
01:44:24,630 --> 01:44:55,190
now? I don't. Well, Billy Meyer was, I believe, the third question. Joe Meyer and the Pleiades and something else. That's the guy. Well, OK, now I have two. I I know Billy Meyer was the third question. I tried to hold on to that, figuring you tackle him in order. All right, I want to ask my audience something. John, I'd like to give some of the people you talked about at the beginning of the program who have seen these craft, including Bob Lazar,

383
01:44:55,510 --> 01:45:23,590
opportunity to call in. So I'm asking everybody on the first time caller line to please hold your calls. Please hold your calls. And if Bob Lazar or any of the other people that John spoke about are out there, please try to call us at area code 70238572137213. How does that sound, John? That sounds great. You know, Bob has taken so much Flack from the

384
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:41,920
the public that, you know, he's just he's real gun shy. So I'm not sure whether he'll call in, but it would sure be nice. Well, perhaps not, but it's legitimate discussion we're having and I I would hope he would decide to do so. All right, let let's see what we've got on the first time caller line. You're on the air, coast to coast. And with our phone, John Lear. Hi.

385
01:45:42,950 --> 01:45:56,270
Hi. Hi there. Would you turn the radio off, please? Yes, I will. Am I on the air now? Well, you are, yes. This is directed to John. And I understand that John and Bob Lazar had built a time machine.

386
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:11,840
Well, that's the story. In fact, you said it, John. John, is that right? If you build a time machine and, and, and could I go to the 50s, please, John? About 55 what I suppose forward in time or backwards in time.

387
01:46:12,430 --> 01:46:42,430
Have you ever tried it out with the bottom line on that story is is I asked Bob if one could be built and he said yes and I said what would we need and he gave me a list of materials of what we would need A lot of it. We couldn't we couldn't get for instance, the power slave you're kidding. You really are thought about doing this, John, Holy macrame in the bottom line is, yes, you could. You could build very easily, build a time machine, not very easily, but a lot simpler than you might think to go forward. Now it's much,

388
01:46:43,190 --> 01:46:52,630
much more difficult to go back in time, but it can be done. Well, Billy Myers I understand went back to the 15th century in France

389
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,560
in his stories and

390
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:16,480
give the Frenchman some information on a battery operated light which he later looked up in a in a encyclopedia when he got back to our time. Wow, you heard about that problem? No, I didn't hear about that. Oh, well, apparently when Bob was at the test site he found,

391
01:47:17,790 --> 01:47:44,510
they told them that there was a solution to the paradox. If you went back in time and killed your father, would you still be alive? The answer is yes, you would. Yes, he would still be alive. But you could go back and kill him. And the reason he would still be alive is, is you can't affect future events. Time is compartmentalized. All right, we've got to hold it there. Caller John, we've got to hold it there. We'll be right back. Boy, do I want to ask you about this. Stay right where you are. You're listening to the CBC and BRN radio networks.

392

408
01:51:25,630 --> 01:51:46,350
Good morning, everybody. Welcome back to the best talk radio in the night time from the Great American Southwest to the rest of the nation. I'm Art Bell. This is called Coast to Coast AM. My guest is John Lear and we're about to get back. Never has John said anything that's caused my ears to perk up there with that last car. I thought he was joking.

409
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:51,920
John Lear building a time machine with Bob Lazar. Time machine. Could it be done?

410
01:51:52,470 --> 01:51:53,710
Should it be done?

411
01:51:54,550 --> 01:52:07,270
I have long all my life been fascinated with the subject of time, as there probably is no other more fascinating to me. And now I realize suddenly that he was serious once again.

412
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:30,720
Brace yourselves, everybody. Here we go. John Lear. Good morning, John. You there again? Old time machine. Really, John? Could it be done? Yeah. Yeah, it could. Yes, it has been done. I mean, we don't. I don't know whether we possess the technology to do it, but certainly someone has it. Would you endeavor to do it?

413
01:52:32,260 --> 01:52:36,700
It's interesting how it works. You could do go forward,

414
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:43,120
but then you'd have to come back. So I don't know whether unless I could come back, whether I'd want to go forward in time.

415
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:54,880
All right, good morning. On the first time caller line, you're on the air, Coast to coast AM with Art Bell and John Lear. Hi, this is Al Lazar. Oh, Bob Lazar. Hi,

416
01:52:56,070 --> 01:53:04,030
Bob Lazar, the son of a gun. Am I glad that you called and you called at an appropriate time to Time Machine Bob?

417
01:53:05,310 --> 01:53:15,110
It's possible. Our John and I building one? No, not at all. It would. At one time John asked me if this was possible, and certainly it is.

418
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:21,760
Time, space, and gravity are all essentially intertwined. That's why,

419
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:31,150
you know, on areas of extreme and extreme gravity flux, for instance, around a black hole, time moves very slowly.

420
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:51,000
Bob, let's pause for a second. I've never had you on the air before. And now that I do, I guess the audience should be introduced to you. So I'll let you do that. Who are you, Bob? And I've heard you. You are a physicist. Is that correct? Yeah, that's correct. Boy, I didn't want to get into a whole big thing. I just kind of wanted to correct

421
01:53:52,990 --> 01:53:56,430
the, I know, but it's my job to try and get you into a whole big thing.

422
01:53:58,600 --> 01:54:07,800
So a couple, just a couple. Tell us a little bit about yourself. I am a physicist. I worked out at Area F4 here in Nevada.

423
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:13,310
I was exposed to some of the alien technology essentially.

424
01:54:14,350 --> 01:54:41,750
I think what John even mentioned before was my job was essentially to assist in the back engineering of the recovered crafts. I only worked on one of them and my knowledge is only limited to the power source, more specifically the antimatter reactor and the propulsion unit, more specifically the gravity amplifier. How many of these discs did you actually see your own eyes?

425
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,680
99, The only one I had physical contact with was 1

426
01:54:46,950 --> 01:54:48,030
was one.

427
01:54:49,230 --> 01:54:57,910
How long were you involved in trying to back engineer that technology? A few months, not not a very long time. Things didn't work out very well

428
01:54:59,070 --> 01:55:06,950
for a whole bunch of different reasons. You ended up leaving, they ended up erasing you. Is the short story. That's correct.

429
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:21,390
Umm, I would ask you what I asked John earlier. Are you aware of any practical application of knowledge gained with that technology that you could point to today?

430
01:55:23,150 --> 01:55:24,350
Actually, none at all. No.

431
01:55:25,270 --> 01:55:27,670
So, in other words, it's all being kept under wraps?

432
01:55:28,670 --> 01:55:40,950
Well, really, a whole lot hasn't been learned. The technology has been in our hands at least some of the crash recoveries for as long as 40 years, but not a whole lot has been gleaned from that.

433
01:55:43,000 --> 01:56:04,720
We know how certain things operate, but in duplicating and duplicating the manufacturing process really doesn't seem to be possible at this time. So there's there's must be little, must be very, very frustrating for them. I'm going to ask you both to hold on just a moment. I'll come right back to you. I've got a very quick break to do. Stay right there.

434
01:56:05,310 --> 01:56:10,390
John Lear and Bob Lazar back in a month. Let me ask you

435
01:56:12,240 --> 01:56:17,920
and good morning from the home of S4 in Area 51, the State of Nevada.

436
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:34,480
This is Coast to Coast AM live talk radio through the night time Monday night, Tuesday morning through Friday night, Saturday morning. I'm Art Bell. I've got John Lear and Bob Lazar on the phone and we're going back to both of them right now. Gentlemen, good morning again.

437
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:40,870
Right? Gee, Bob, back to the time thing for a second now, if we might,

438
01:56:42,910 --> 01:56:57,030
if you're saying a it would be possible, well, it's, it's only possible. It happens quite often. I mean this this sounds really far out, but it's known scientific fact that

439
01:56:58,030 --> 01:57:26,470
the closer you are to a strong gravity force, the slower time moves. Time, gravity, and space are all intertwined like that. In fact, there was a famous experiment that was done to synchronize. Atomic clocks were placed side by side. They read the same time and one was put at sea level. The end was put up at a either in a plane or a high mountain top, I don't recall which. And when they were brought back together, they both read different times.

440
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:34,120
That was because of the change in gravity. One was further away from the source of gravity being the Earth. Now, if you can artificially create

441
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:59,750
a tremendous gravitational field, you can slow the effects of time down for the person that's in that distorted field. Now the practical implications would be very difficult. First of all, all that would do would be slow down time for you. Everyone else essentially continues along the normal pace. So it it appears that you move forward in time. As far as moving back, I haven't the slightest idea how you would do that, but it's it's certainly possible

442
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:05,080
for the time. In fact, the shuttle astronauts or the astronauts that went to the moon

443
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:31,790
came back, I believe 34 seconds younger than their counterparts here just because of the gravity changes that they went through. Wow. Is this not a, isn't there a similar phenomenon associated theoretically with black holes or the edge, the event horizon of black holes? Just just because that's, you know, a tremendous gravitational field. And in fact, at the very event horizon of a black hole, time doesn't increment at all.

444
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:37,120
For instance, if you walked over to that area near the event horizon or somehow

445
01:58:37,950 --> 01:59:08,310
was able to survive it, spent a second there, you could come back to Earth and a billion years could have elapsed. You know, the time reference has completely changed. So the whole key is distorting gravity, creating a strong gravitational field, which in fact is how the crafts, these crafts, they have it As for are powered and they bend or jump through bends in space or create bins in space. How would you explain that, Bob? Well, they, they essentially create them.

446
01:59:08,670 --> 01:59:34,230
They're using a device to artificially create gravity. This device and turns part of its nature. Gravity distorts time and space. It bends space, it bends time. And this is how they, this is how they travel. The discussion I got into, John, was, well, Gee, you know, could is it possible to build something like that? Well, yeah, if you did have an antimatter reactor or gravity amplifier

447
01:59:35,080 --> 01:59:38,760
and somehow it could contain the field so it wouldn't crush the occupant.

448
01:59:39,150 --> 01:59:46,070
And yeah, I guess I know where there's a gravity amplifier, just not too many miles from here. Huh? You're right getting it's the problem.

449
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:54,360
So if you could put your hands on something like that, that might be then one practical application of the alien technology.

450
01:59:55,830 --> 02:00:20,310
Well, is it that practical, though? Well, you did something like that and could turn it on, sit in a chair and it there's really, I don't see any way of going back, but theoretically there should be. I, I did ask John this and let me try it on you. He couldn't answer it said I ought to ask you if you could. First of all, could a biological entity pass through a black hole without being?

451
02:00:21,160 --> 02:00:24,480
Disrupted or something? And if So, what would be on the other side, Bob,

452
02:00:25,630 --> 02:00:28,990
I don't know and I don't, I don't believe anyone does know.

453
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:55,640
There's just isn't enough information about black holes to to come up with that answer as a guess. You know, you look at it from a physical standpoint, the gravitational tidal forces entering the black hole should absolutely obliterate anything that even comes near it. But you know, stranger things have happened and maybe not so. So really, who knows?

454
02:00:56,590 --> 02:01:13,990
How much technology are you missing aside from the gravity amplifier, the ability to make a time machine, or in fact, in fact, something that would cause you to travel through time? Are we missing a lot of other technology or given the gravity amp, could you go from there?

455
02:01:14,710 --> 02:01:22,710
Well, you don't even, you really don't even have to do that. Another way is, you know, just accelerating close to the speed of light slows time. Also,

456
02:01:24,230 --> 02:01:28,430
uh, that doesn't make any technology, so it's probably not the safest thing to do.

457
02:01:30,280 --> 02:01:43,280
What would theoretically occur to somebody who either came came to? Is it possible, Bob, to exceed the speed of light in the physical universe without bending warping space to do it?

458
02:01:43,870 --> 02:01:52,350
No, it's not. No it's not. As you got near the speed of light, what would occur in all likelihood to a biological entity?

459
02:01:53,310 --> 02:01:55,550
All kinds of things. First of all, it's not.

460
02:01:56,470 --> 02:02:13,350
It would now because of several things that occur. One of them being is mass increase. As you approach the speed of light, you begin to increase in mass and therefore it requires more energy to propel you further or faster. Rather, you kind of get stuck in a little loop there,

461
02:02:15,120 --> 02:02:19,120
so then great distances really are never going to be traveled that way.

462
02:02:20,190 --> 02:02:22,070
No, they can't be that. Uh,

463
02:02:23,710 --> 02:02:25,550
that just isn't practical. On top of that,

464
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:34,360
yeah, you can go on for a long time about that. It's not practical. It really isn't OK.

465
02:02:37,910 --> 02:02:48,990
I guess you left the project with the disks at one point of you do our audience a great favor by describing it as much detail as you're able to what it is you saw and worked on, Bob.

466
02:02:51,010 --> 02:02:53,010
I worked on one particular craft

467
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:58,750
that I called the Sport model because of its very sleek appearance.

468
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:08,400
Specifically, like I mentioned before, there is a small reactor that was removed from the craft and

469
02:03:09,870 --> 02:03:10,750
we

470
02:03:13,010 --> 02:03:26,890
essentially back engineered it. What we needed to do was find out not only how it worked, but also very important to the project was to see if this technology could be duplicated. One of the main problems in any kind of aircraft

471
02:03:28,840 --> 02:03:46,920
is power. And with a tremendous amount of power, you can basically do anything. And here's a reactor that operates, you know, many times more efficiently than a efficient reactor or more efficiently than a, a fusion reactor, which we haven't even developed yet,

472
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:54,430
umm, you know, ever could. And it supplies a tremendous amount of power. And this is

473
02:03:55,230 --> 02:04:14,870
essentially where we decided to start from was to work from here and then then go on. But you know, all the time that they had this and the time that I spent there, the short time that I spent there, really there's just not a lot you can do. We just don't have the materials to duplicate it. Any ideas what this craft was made of? What kind of metal or substance it was?

474
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:21,470
I I say it's metal just because I felt it. It felt cold. It had the appearance of metal.

475
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:25,040
The grain structure appeared to be

476
02:04:26,350 --> 02:04:35,270
metal, but I don't know. I, you know, like I'm sure John has mentioned, the information is very compartmentalized. And

477
02:04:36,830 --> 02:04:41,030
could you describe the interior of the craft? Were you inside?

478
02:04:41,590 --> 02:05:04,550
Interior was very bare. There had been some equipment removed from it. There was a reactor. There were two seats. There were two consoles left, one large console. I call them my console. There was nothing on top. One of them was removed. I believe they're part of the gravity amplifiers that are connected directly underneath.

479
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:10,400
They're in a triad formation. These are going to be some silly questions,

480
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:26,990
Bob, but were there windows? I mean, by what manner could you see or understand any of the technology that was in front of you, normal buttons, switches, gauges, or really, really wasn't anything like that. Buttons and switches there wasn't really wasn't even wiring.

481
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:33,160
I I know that sounds really bizarre, but it, it really isn't that

482
02:05:34,790 --> 02:05:43,110
that's strange. A lot of the a lot of equipment, it almost appeared to be something similar to a Tesla coil. The way

483
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:54,780
so every time I ate on a topic I have to regress. And sure, I understand that's what I'm talking about, but it almost seemed like every piece of equipment was tuned

484
02:05:56,430 --> 02:06:08,190
to whatever it was supposed to be receiving signals from and it was essentially electrical power transmission without wires, which is not something far out. There was something a man named Tesla accomplished in the 30s.

485
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:13,040
However, this seemed to be along the same lines with much more advanced.

486
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:24,710
Well, while we're on the subject, do you think mankind will ever manage to bring power from space to Earth through some method or another? As if it's the same sort of technology, I presume.

487
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:49,980
I don't know. It's about the best I could say about that. OK Well, anyway, back, back to these. What was it like when you went in the room? I mean, I can only imagine they would lead you in these guys with their little badges and so forth, and they would lead you into the area You're going to be working on these things. And you must have looked at them and said you've got to be kidding. Well, it wasn't. I only got

488
02:06:50,840 --> 02:06:52,040
to physically view the craft

489
02:06:54,560 --> 02:07:02,640
twice. Once was when I went inside to see the placement of the parts that I was to be concentrating on. The other one was in a short flight test.

490
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:15,400
A flight test. I wasn't inside. I saw it from inside the hangar. And what did you see? Just lifted off the ground, almost silently. It had a slight hissing sound to it,

491
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:25,480
then drifted. It was quite amazing. I mean, I speak of it nonchalantly right now, but it's, you know, there again. This was several years ago.

492
02:07:26,190 --> 02:07:26,630
Wow. Umm,

493
02:07:28,790 --> 02:07:57,150
you know again, back for a second the magnetism. Large magnetic fields have indeed done strange things. Do you recall anything of the story, The Philadelphia experiment? I've heard a lot about it, and I want to run things. This is an unusual opportunity, Bob, so I want to run something by you. I had a friend, somebody I regarded as truly honest and extremely credible, and he told me about an experiment

494
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,760
that he saw participated in in Arizona

495
02:08:01,760 --> 02:08:21,560
in which a very extremely large electromagnetic field was created. And he claims that that he saw something disappear. I mean, flat, completely **** disappear when exposed to this field. Is such thing possible?

496
02:08:23,930 --> 02:08:24,770
Well,

497
02:08:25,830 --> 02:08:47,830
it's kind of a loaded question. Is it possible for something to disappear when exposed to a large electromagnetic field? Yes. Do I think it that happened during the Philadelphia experiment? No. Do I think that mankind right now is capable of doing that? No. There isn't sufficient power generated in the entire output of the planet at this time to create a field of that distortion.

498
02:08:49,500 --> 02:08:58,740
Well, would the power plants inside these discs be capable of that kind of generation?

499
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:00,640
Yes.

500
02:09:01,390 --> 02:09:12,150
What, what, what, what was the fuel of these crap, Bob, there had these. There's some sort of fuel, energy burned, expended, used, right.

501
02:09:13,030 --> 02:09:24,510
Yeah. The fuel was. Well, let me progress for a moment here that there are three types of nuclear reactions. One's a fishing reaction, which everyone's familiar with. It's

502
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:52,720
essentially how atomic bombs work. It's a splitting of atoms and causing a chain reaction. It releases X amount of energy. Another more efficient reaction is a fusion reaction, which releases a little more energy. Both of these, for instance, when putting bombs, whether they're thermonuclear, the hydrogen bomb or the fission bomb, an atomic bomb they use about 9/10 of 1%

503
02:09:53,440 --> 02:09:56,560
of that fuel gets converted into the actual explosive energy.

504
02:09:58,230 --> 02:10:00,750
Now, if you really think about that, when you're dealing with

505
02:10:02,520 --> 02:10:11,400
a plutonium bomb, for instance, you're dealing with, oh, somewhere on the order of about 8 lbs of plutonium, which is about

506
02:10:12,790 --> 02:10:15,350
the size a little bigger than a golf ball.

507
02:10:16,790 --> 02:10:32,150
Now, 8 tenths of 1% of that makes that giant explosion that you see, all the other material is wasted. That's how efficient that explosion is. Now an annihilation reaction, which is a conversion.

508
02:10:33,390 --> 02:10:40,830
The direct conversion of matter to energy is 100% efficient all the time. And you can see if

509
02:10:42,990 --> 02:11:06,030
if that were put into a bomb, I made a tape explaining this so I didn't have to. So you didn't have to explain it all the time to people like me. I, you know, I didn't get stuck on the radio. All right, As long as we're in these categories of fusion. I want to ask one more question in that category. And it has to do with cold fusion. A number of people, even some very recent claims of the creation of cold fusion.

510
02:11:07,480 --> 02:11:12,200
Is it going to be possible, Bob, do you think eventually to have a cold fusion process?

511
02:11:12,550 --> 02:11:16,830
Absolutely not. No, absolutely not. I'll make a bet on it right now.

512
02:11:18,310 --> 02:11:42,630
Absolutely not. So what was it that these came out of power, Thor What was it that you know, what was it these scientists came up with that caused the bubbling and the heating and the, you know, the, the parent creation of energy? Any idea what it was? I, I'm sticking with Los Alamos explanation was essentially an electrochemical reaction that took place. Did fusion occur? No,

513
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:48,040
there was far, far too many experiments done that

514
02:11:48,750 --> 02:11:54,430
suppose a duplicate experiment, and I mean these yielded no results at all.

515
02:11:56,280 --> 02:12:21,160
And the physics behind it don't make any sense either. All right, the again going back to the disks, the the fuel they use apparently is elements something or another that goes beyond our table of elements. Is that correct? Yeah, it's element 115 and then absolute definite, but that's what it appears to be element 151. Fourteen. Chances are it's 1:15. And

516
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:28,680
interestingly enough, it's a stable element and I was familiar with the way the periodic table works. We elements go.

517
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:35,310
As they get higher and higher on the periodic chart, they become less and less stable and begin to decay.

518
02:12:35,790 --> 02:12:59,750
But this is a stable element. And again, this isn't something that's a total surprise. I mean, we've known all the way since the 50s and six, well, probably the 60s, that somewhere there is a magic combination of protons and neutrons that again, somewhere in the higher elements will make a stable element. And apparently that does happen up at that level.

519
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:05,320
Have you had your hands on any 115 Bob? I have had my hands very close to it.

520
02:13:06,310 --> 02:13:10,270
Is there anyone 15 that exists outside of S4? Now

521
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:14,080
that you don't have to answer all of these, Bob,

522
02:13:15,870 --> 02:13:16,510
who knows?

523
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:28,640
Let me since I've got the two of you on the line, what would you say is your greatest area of agreement, the two of you

524
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:32,680
that we live in Las Vegas.

525
02:13:34,750 --> 02:14:04,430
Well, that makes the next one then. Very. He's going to say that I'm not No, no, I'm just kidding around. I John has a lot. I essentially have cut off whatever I haven't had contact with. So there can be talks of reptilian like aliens or abductions and things like that. And I know there's lots of evidence that that people were abducted. And I did see the thing on Fox the other day with a guy that got burns on him. And that's, that's all interesting. But

526
02:14:04,670 --> 02:14:35,470
it's something strange that happens to you once you've been actually involved with something. You kind of put blinders on to the rest of the world and now you only want to deal with something that you physically had hands on experience with. Oh, very much like what I said earlier. And you've had hands on one of these discs. Have you ever seen? No, I'm kind of taking the attitude some people take towards me, but I'm not doing it on purpose. I well, you know, if I actually get abducted, then I'll start believing that.

527
02:14:35,750 --> 02:14:57,910
And that's, yeah, but I'm sure that way. But that's, that's just the way I think. Well, yeah. But Bob, why having had your hands on a disk, are you not easily able to make the leap to the the Grays or the Blacks or any of the other eighty 80s supposed varieties of aliens in terms of accepting their existence?

528
02:14:58,990 --> 02:15:21,030
Well, they, I'm sure there are other civilizations all over the place. I just, I don't know. I don't, I haven't seen evidence of others civilizations. I guess you are you absolutely convinced that those disks and that technology did not come from or originate here on Earth? Oh, beyond the shadow of a doubt. Well, unless they were robots. Somebody brought them here then.

529
02:15:21,910 --> 02:15:28,510
Oh, certainly. You know, some form of other creature had to have brought them here. There's no doubt about that.

530
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:38,840
I just don't know if there are 100 different civilizations visiting Earth. I don't know if a hundred other civilizations could find it.

531
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:54,160
I'm just, it's possible. I just, I just shy away from that. All right, This sounds then like an area of disagreement between the two of you. I really can't take a stance on it because I don't know. This is just a personal feeling.

532
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:59,190
You sort of are cautious though in commenting in that area. Sure.

533
02:16:00,510 --> 02:16:16,310
What would you 2 say is the biggest disagreement you have regarding all of this? Would that be it or is there some other area? I, I don't know, you'd have to ask John. How about it, John? I don't think we have. I can't think of a real disagreement.

534
02:16:17,950 --> 02:16:31,310
So no real disagreements. All right, gentlemen, I would. I'm going to do my best to hold on to you for a while here if I can, Bob, and maybe even take a few calls. You up for that kind of thing? Are are you up? Are you ready to go to sleep?

535
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:45,320
Sleep is kind of on my priority list here. Is it? Can you give me a few more minutes? Sure. All right. Very good. Then both of you stand by. What a what a distinct pleasure. Bob Lazar

536
02:16:46,390 --> 02:16:56,070
and and John Lear both here, both together again. I guess they are frequently and we'll get them back on the air together here in a moment

537
02:16:57,590 --> 02:17:00,590
on the CBC and VRN Radio network.

538
02:17:01,350 --> 02:17:04,470
I'm Art Bell and I will tell you later how to get copies,

539
02:17:06,200 --> 02:17:13,200
tape copies of this program because I know there's a lot of people having conniption fits now, wanting one. We'll be back in a moment.

540
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:52,510
Good morning again from the Great American Southwest. I'm Art Bell and Bob Lazar and John Lear are both with me at the moment. Back to them we go. Gentlemen, you're on the air once again. You doing art. Good morning,

541
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:55,320
Bob. While we've still got you,

542
02:17:58,310 --> 02:18:05,590
you know, after you've gone through all this, this disaster that's been what, how long has this been going on now, Bob? For a couple of years now,

543
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:31,960
is there anything you want to say to everybody about having gone through all this? I mean, would you do it again? Would you go public again? Or would you say, boy, I'd no more open my mouth than the man in the moon? I don't know. It's a tough call. It's something that has to be decided on, you know, as as things are happening. But at the given the same set of circumstances, I probably would have done the same thing, perhaps a little different.

544
02:18:33,880 --> 02:18:55,000
A lot of magazines are writing a lot of things about both of you. Do you find they generally get it right, or is it exaggerated baloney that most of them print? Well, most of the people don't have access to the information. What? And I'm part of the problem. I don't do interviews, I don't do talk shows. I don't

545
02:18:56,030 --> 02:18:58,870
doing I don't go around give lectures, I just don't do anything

546
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:30,920
and I'm constantly being hounded for information. So without the information, they tend to make some of it up probably. Well, so some of the information has come out, especially in George nap special. I I you know, that's where I essentially spilled my guts, said everything that happened to me and kind of want to or wanted to really leave it at that. The technical information I made a tape about for the people that really wanted to know the nitty gritty and left it at that and and that was it. And you know, people would look through those two things. You know, everything essentially that I

547
02:19:31,590 --> 02:19:35,070
happened was, was contained within those two things.

548
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:47,360
But you know, inevitably things get screwed up and a lot of hearsay and there's an awful 99.9% of the UFO community

549
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:56,560
is are crazy. These these people are just absolutely out of their minds and I really want to have nothing to do with them. And

550
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:02,680
they're, they're tied in with, I mean, all kinds of strange factions of groups and.

551
02:20:04,590 --> 02:20:07,430
Yeah, it's really impossible to weed out

552
02:20:08,350 --> 02:20:24,590
any real information coming from most of these sources, these magazines and even the larger groups. So I really have to stay away from it. And that gets people upset and thinks I'm trying to hide things from them. And I'm called government agents and stuff like that. And it's,

553
02:20:25,950 --> 02:20:27,510
you know, the list is never ending

554
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:34,280
in 99 9/10% to Bob, perhaps more. But

555
02:20:38,110 --> 02:20:55,150
with your continued association then with John Lear, I take it you view him in one of the top very small percentage points of those who may be on to something. No, I don't. I don't really associate with John Lear does his own thing and I, you know, I, I.

556
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:16,360
Hey, and there's an awful 99.9% of the UFO community is are crazy. These these people are just absolutely out of their minds and I really want to have nothing to do with them. And

557
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:22,440
they're, they're tied in with, I mean, all kinds of strange factions of groups. And

558
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:27,000
yeah, it it's really impossible to weed out

559
02:21:28,070 --> 02:21:44,390
any real information coming from most of these sources, these magazines and even the larger groups. I really have to stay away from it. And that gets people upset and thinks I'm trying to hide things from them. And I'm called government agents and stuff like that. And it's,

560
02:21:45,790 --> 02:21:47,830
you know, the list is never ending.

561
02:21:49,630 --> 02:21:54,270
Umm 99 9/10% to Bob. Perhaps more, but

562
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:23,600
with your continued association then with John Lear, I take it you view him in one of the top of very small percentage points of those who may be on to something. No, I don't. I don't really associate with John Lear does his own thing and I, you know, I I don't. John comments. Yeah, we, we have some of my ideas are far out because I'm not a scientist. Bob is a scientist.

563
02:22:24,030 --> 02:22:48,270
He dealt with things that he saw with work with were proven to him. To me, it's, you know, all I'm dealing with is speculation. I've heard and and that's what I deal with. Well, exactly. But to the casual observer, somebody like me, everything you've told me, John, about how they travel, of means of propulsion, the kind of creatures they are, all the rest of this sort of thing

564
02:22:49,160 --> 02:22:57,080
is, is underwritten or strengthened by what Bob Lazar says. I mean, don't you realize that, Bob? You're saying I saw the discs. Yes, they exist.

565
02:22:57,510 --> 02:23:27,640
Oh yeah, the the information, like I said, the only information I know are the technical aspects of the craft. And that information John has we've talked about that and he understands it and the information that he relays like that is absolutely correct. And I I'll verify that I, I actually got to work with that stuff. I don't know, you know, I alien didn't take me to their planet. I don't have proof where they came from. I don't know how

566
02:23:28,270 --> 02:23:41,790
any deal was cut. I don't know about abductions. I don't know about all that other stuff. Listen to me. We've got to stop here. I've got a newscaster I've got to do. Please stay around just a little while longer, will you, Bob? Sure. All right. Stay right there

567
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:56,640
when you visit Las Vegas, you can enjoy yourself at Jackie Gonz Plaza Hotel at the top of Maine and Fremont. We invite you to participate on the Talk of the 1-800-257-3825.

568
02:23:57,270 --> 02:24:03,030
And now back to John Lear and Bob Lazar. You're both back on the air again.

569
02:24:04,030 --> 02:24:32,790
OK, well, this is all flooring me a bit, but it's fun. Just like to say it's really a privilege to be on with Bombay. You know, he is my friend, but he just never goes on any of these interviews and it's just really nice to to hand him on for once to. He doesn't back me up on everything, but he does back me up and on the stuff that he saw. Well, let's try a question on you here. That's very nice compliment for Bob. If Bob Lazar did get the the equipment or the technology never did build a time machine,

570
02:24:33,230 --> 02:24:37,310
would you sit in it while he pulled the switch? Sure you would.

571
02:24:40,120 --> 02:24:47,000
I think he would. Bob. No, it's it's strange. I've, I get a lot of letters from people and

572
02:24:48,910 --> 02:25:18,550
there have been of quite a few people that really think that I have a time machine. And I would, I would really like to know how this got started. I mean, there are people with honest requests wanting to know how much that I would charge them. They need to go back to the 50s to rescue their, their brother from being killed or something like that. And you know, I really have to make it clear, I, I really don't have a time machine and I don't possess the technology to make one either.

573
02:25:18,990 --> 02:25:30,750
Please don't, don't write to me asking that. Well, there is this though, Bob. If you had built a time machine using some of that technology, would you be likely to admit it?

574
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:43,080
That may give you some clues to why people think that you may have it even though you say you don't. Yeah. Well,

575
02:25:44,800 --> 02:26:06,800
I'd, I'd like to drink well taken. I guess I would like to take just a couple of calls just for the fun of it and let's see if anybody has any questions. Listen, before we do, can I just tell the folks how to get ahold of this tape that Bob put out? Because he won't advertise himself. But really think it's important that if you do want to know about this technology and what Bob saw up at the test site,

576
02:26:07,190 --> 02:26:37,830
he does have a videotape available and you can write to try dot Corporation, that's TRIDOT, Tridot Corporation 1324 Southeastern, and then that's in Las Vegas and it's Las Vegas 891-O four. And the price is 2995 + 3 dollars shipping and handling. And if you want to know about this stuff, you just can't make a better investment. I know Bob doesn't advertise this very much,

577
02:26:37,950 --> 02:26:41,710
but I think it's really important. Yeah, There's going to be another one too, isn't there, Bob?

578
02:26:44,030 --> 02:26:50,390
You know, it's kind of in the works and but that tape was a lot of people that

579
02:26:51,310 --> 02:27:02,830
viewed the first tape. It was, it's a technical tape, but it's made for the layman to understand all the technology and how how it works. And there's just been a request for a tape that goes heavy into the physics.

580
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:22,920
A lot of technical people, scientists and that sort of thing, want all the specifics, exactly, formulas and things along those lines. And that's what the second tape will probably cover. I'm not really sure about that yet. Nothing's been done with it. And what kind of technology would that give away?

581
02:27:25,070 --> 02:27:30,230
Well, really we're just talking about the how specifically the amplifiers work

582
02:27:32,850 --> 02:27:51,040
things, things along those lines with the knowledge Bob of roughly how they work. Would it be possible for somebody on this earth to, to eventually, do you feel, build or duplicate that technology and build something that would do with that power plant does?

583
02:27:51,750 --> 02:27:55,590
Well, It's just a matter of having access to certain material.

584
02:27:56,710 --> 02:28:02,510
Umm, with some super heavy elements such as element 115,

585
02:28:02,990 --> 02:28:10,670
umm, with the proper materials, we could absolutely build it. Uh, the technology is not

586
02:28:11,630 --> 02:28:13,670
millions of years ahead of us.

587
02:28:15,030 --> 02:28:42,750
You're looking at technology that's maybe hundreds and hundreds of years ahead of us. It's not that phenomenal. It really isn't. A lot of people, you know, talk about it being even billions of years and it, it really isn't. This technology is not that far fetched once you get your hands around it. So it is quite feasible that we could eventually duplicate these systems, but not with materials that we have readily available right now.

588
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:45,760
There'd have to be another source for these materials

589
02:28:46,390 --> 02:29:13,830
coming in. I asked this of John earlier and it's another one he couldn't quite answer, but came up with a good answer nevertheless. I heard in astrologer who said that the Sun over the last two months Bob has lost roughly 110th of 1% of its output. Now while I guess the output of the Sun, which is a nuclear Dynamo is does vacillate a little bit, this seemed to that person somewhat worrisome.

590
02:29:14,720 --> 02:29:16,160
Any any comments on that?

591
02:29:16,670 --> 02:29:42,350
I wouldn't be really concerned. I mean the sun has a tremendous hydrogen supply, which is being, you know, fusion reaction is being converted to helium. And you don't really have to be concerned about anything running out for probably about 5 billion years. And then at that point there be some pretty dramatic changes. There's no real problem that could develop in it causing enough of a drop to to affect us ecologically.

592
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:59,760
As a matter of fact, when the sun begins to run out of fuel, it's going to swell. So it's not going to burn out like a candle. All right, indulge. Just a couple calls. Here we are. A talk show. Wild card. Line three, You're on the air. Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell, John Lynn, Bob Lazar.

593
02:30:01,230 --> 02:30:09,910
I finally made it in. Good, good, good. Where are you calling from, Sir? Las Vegas. Las Vegas. All right, All right. What I wanted to ask about

594
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:15,040
the saucers and the alien technology was

595
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:32,920
they must operate off from some type of communication frequency. Is it any way possible to put together some sort of a transmitter so that one could start putting out a a signal to them?

596
02:30:33,630 --> 02:30:52,550
All right, it's a good question, Bob. Any insights into whatever communications capabilities they had? Well, what bothers me with the communication, and of course there must be some in the craft, is that because of the gravitational field, everything is going to be distorted around the craft,

597
02:30:52,910 --> 02:30:57,630
whether it's radio waves, whether it's light waves. And in fact, someone had asked earlier

598
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:26,080
how crabs, I think they asked how crabs seemingly disappears or underneath it. Well, this again is characteristic of the gravity amplifier that it actually pulls light around it. For instance, I even mentioned in my tape that there are stars that are behind the sun where the sun actually blocks our view and we can see those stars. The reason why is the sun has tremendous amount of gravity, pulls the light from the star up and around the sun. So we can see it

599
02:31:26,910 --> 02:31:55,590
in these discs when they're operating. If they're in something called an Omicron configuration. If you're standing underneath the disc, you can't see it. You can only see the sky above it. By the way, light is bent around the craft. Now the way I understand this, to envelope the craft, I can't see how radio waves can get into the craft. And that's, that's something that's puzzled me for a while. So there must be some other form of communication.

600
02:31:56,070 --> 02:32:19,950
What would the would the gravity amplifiers themselves possibly provide the key to the kind of communication they used? In other words, something propelled or moved through time or space or both with the same technology. In other words, each new technology. Lasers, for example, can be modulated and and you can use light to

601
02:32:20,760 --> 02:32:25,880
to to pass voice. And so I wonder if their technology might have in it a key

602
02:32:26,430 --> 02:32:43,310
to their communications. It's quite possible, quite possible. There is something called along the lines of a gravity phone, something that John and I have spoke about in depth that it essentially is a gravity amplifier with a modulated output and it is received

603
02:32:45,040 --> 02:33:11,760
again, you know, this is just an educated guess, but it's certainly possible. But as far as there being a frequency you can TuneIn or transmit, I, I don't, I haven't seen anything along those lines that the crafts would receive. So then their communications might be ever good as advanced or different would be a better way to put it than anything. We're familiar with traditional RF frequencies. And so probably because they're traveling such tremendous distances,

604
02:33:13,230 --> 02:33:22,990
the crap would get there years before their transmission did. So they can't use regular radio transmission, they have to use something that actually bends.

605
02:33:24,840 --> 02:33:38,160
One would think that any insight into that at all might give one the ability eventually then to communicate, if not travel to these creatures, but communicate with their their point of origin, right? I agree.

606
02:33:40,200 --> 02:33:43,640
Wild card line three, you're on the air Coast to Coast AM with the group.

607
02:33:45,440 --> 02:34:04,720
Hello. Are you there? Yeah, Yes, Sir. Turn your radio off #1 OK. OK. I've been trying to get through to you for a long time. Where are you calling from? I'm calling in from Las Vegas. All right, go ahead. The first question, is this directed to John Lear? Do the aliens have philosophy about their own creator or creation

608
02:34:05,950 --> 02:34:13,270
#2 the Super clarity that is to be built in Texas? Is that going to give any clue as to their

609
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:35,880
technological technological advances? All right, well, there's a question for each one of those really the philosophy. And I'd like to hear Bobby answer on that Super Collider. I've heard many people say, oh, they're they're building that to to make 115 and I and I never asked Bob about it. Element 115. Bob, what about, what can you tell us about the Super Collider?

610
02:34:36,750 --> 02:34:43,070
Well, I to be honest with you, I don't know a whole lot about the Super Collider. I do know the basic plan and

611
02:34:44,720 --> 02:34:46,320
you know what they're what they're attempting to do

612
02:34:49,080 --> 02:35:01,480
is is it going to be used to make 115? Now that you know, again, this if you're going to assemble an incredibly heavy element like that, other elements that we've synthesized up to one O 9

613
02:35:03,360 --> 02:35:14,480
and that hasn't been really documented, but these have been put in accelerators for an incredibly long time at at A at a tremendous cost of electrical power.

614
02:35:15,270 --> 02:35:25,270
And you know, we essentially have a yield of one or two atoms of the substance. If you're talking about something much higher than that, like an element 115,

615
02:35:26,390 --> 02:35:44,310
it's just inconceivable. You'd have to have this tremendous thing running at full power for decades to to wind up with, with several atoms of a substance it if it can be done. And so I I've always contended that element 115 has got to,

616
02:35:45,310 --> 02:35:57,710
or it must have been naturally created. All right, I'm right on top of another break, and Gee whiz, there's just not enough time to say goodbye. So I guess you'll have to stay there for a minute. Stand by,

617

Good morning again from the home of S4 Area 51

628
02:39:50,520 --> 02:40:00,240
and Bob Lazar and John Lear and they're my guests. I'm Art Bell. We're going back now to the phones and you're both back on the air again.

629
02:40:00,790 --> 02:40:25,390
Yard I don't know how you did it. That's again it's an honor for me to be on the same program with Bob. I I know the Pope couldn't get an interview with him. I don't know how you did it really is well it's it is indeed an honor to have you here, Bob. It really is. If I might let's let's expose you both to some more of the people Wild card line three. You're on the air coast to coast AM with a group. Good morning.

630
02:40:26,240 --> 02:40:33,320
Oh yes boy, I'm really honored. This is my second time. I called earlier on the first time caller line,

631
02:40:34,070 --> 02:40:45,910
you couldn't remember my third question which had to do with Atlantis. Oh, thank you. Yes, thank you and thank you for the call back, John. That's right. It was about

632
02:40:49,160 --> 02:40:52,960
for a lot of mythology. The the one thing that that

633
02:40:53,510 --> 02:41:20,470
that I can't find any information on is where did the myth of the dragon come from? Was there really something? I mean, usually there is a basis in in in fact, of of most mythology, something happened to make that. But I've always wanted where the dragon came from. All right, well, at least you addressed it. Thank you. Good morning. You're on the air Coast to coast AM with the group here. All right, hold on. Let me turn now. Hurry. Where are you calling from? Arizona. Arizona. All right,

634
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:29,960
Yeah, I wanted to know before you. I'm picking up off of K Don, so you're about ready to go out, but I want to know where I can get the tapes from

635
02:41:30,230 --> 02:41:48,830
the copies of them. All right. They I'm sure that'll please them. John, why don't you go ahead and give out the the address where the Tridot Corporation, TRIDOT Corporation and it's 1324. That's 1324 Southeastern

636
02:41:50,310 --> 02:41:52,270
and it's Las Vegas, NV

02:42:52,870 --> 02:43:09,670
I guess, went along with you and went along with you and looked at and investigated what was his personal determination after he finished looking, finished looking into this and did his show. Do you know George and app you mean? That's right.

645
02:43:11,550 --> 02:43:38,510
I'd like to answer that question. He was so such a firm believer that he he nearly discredited himself on a new show by once one of the the girls said, well, George, what do you think? And instead of the stock news man's answer of saying, well, I think this deserves more investigation, he said, I believe it. And he was called to pass by his boss for saying that. So did he see anything that we didn't see

646
02:43:39,640 --> 02:43:42,480
made of? May have had access to some information?

647
02:43:43,430 --> 02:44:09,070
But now George wasn't that ardent of a believer in the beginning as I wasn't either before I got involved with the project. But George did go to great lengths traveling with me to Los Alamos and I mean, going all over the place, tracing down Leeds and things added up quickly to someone put that put in that much effort and he essentially put everything together. And you know, yes, I have that show on tape. It was really something,

648
02:44:09,790 --> 02:44:40,230
really something. All right, just one more very quick interruption. Gentlemen. I'll be right back to you. Stay right there.

651
02:45:29,840 --> 02:45:34,040
from Jackie Gonz Plaza downtown. This is KDWN Las Vegas.

652
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:43,160


653
02:45:52,590 --> 02:46:16,550
Good morning again from Las Vegas. I'm Art Bell on the CBC and BRN radio networks. Let me take care of something real quick here and we'll plow back in with clear sailing. The perfect gift, as I've described you earlier for any woman as flowers. I mean, there's no question about it. I don't care whether it's a birthday or an anniversary or just I'm, I'm sorry or I'm happy or I'm in love or whatever it is. Flowers always cut it,

654
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:26,800
and flowers are always cut when they're sent sent from absolutely fresh flowers. No kidding. It's the perfect gift because you don't have to go out and shop for it.

655
02:46:27,310 --> 02:46:48,910
You can do it right from home. You can order from home. I'm going to tell you how in a second. You don't have to wrap it up, take it to the post office, mail it across the country because they'll deliver it on the day you specify anywhere in the country. It's it's really that there's no deal like it. And there are, since you're dealing, you see, directly with a flower farm instead of a retail outlet,

656
02:46:50,640 --> 02:46:59,200
you get the best deal straight out. So order now. Christmas time is here, and if you've been delaying, here's a way to take care of it. Just like that.

657
02:46:59,670 --> 02:47:14,470
The number is 1-800-562-6438, 1-800-562-6438. Absolutely fresh flowers. And John Lehrer and Bob Lazar, welcome back.

658
02:47:17,640 --> 02:47:30,160
I, I is there anything, Bob, that since you don't make public appearances and you don't go on talk shows, is there anything that you've been wanting to say to the public and haven't had a chance to for a while now?

659
02:47:32,350 --> 02:47:35,790
No, not nothing that comes to mind at the spur of the moment.

660
02:47:36,870 --> 02:47:46,830
All right, let's take a couple of more calls. Good morning. Wild card line three, you're on the air. Coast to Coast AM with the group here. Yeah, I'd like to drag my question to John Lear's.

661
02:47:48,630 --> 02:47:53,550
What any of this has to do with the English wheat fields where they make those designs and

662
02:47:54,870 --> 02:48:21,590
which aliens changes those 64 different modifications? Was it the Grays? All right, thank you, Sir. The crop circles first. Obviously it has something to do with the, the crop circles, but I don't know what. And, and I don't interest myself much for that, that phenomenon. It's, it's pretty weird. And I, I read the magazines and stuff and look at it, but, but I don't know anything about it. Well, I'm, I'm interested in directing a little of that to, to Bob. Bob,

663
02:48:22,400 --> 02:48:23,680
since you're a physicist, these

664
02:48:24,030 --> 02:48:34,830
damn crop circles, they really are all over the world. They're in Australia. They're in too many places for two guys and a board and a chain. You know, what could they? What could they be?

665
02:48:36,390 --> 02:48:48,510
I don't know. Certainly it can be. I mean it's possible of I'm sure there are other explanation. It could certainly be the footprint of of one of the crafts. The crafts can certainly be at altitude and compress

666
02:48:50,240 --> 02:48:52,440
a wheat field down like that. That's that's not a problem.

667
02:48:54,400 --> 02:49:01,200
As far as what else, it could possibly be some other prosaic explanation. I really, I really don't know.

668
02:49:02,550 --> 02:49:16,390
And John, I think there was more of a question for you. Yeah, he said what what, what group was it that that did the genetic alterations? I like Bob to answer that because he's the one that read the document and I just quote from what he said.

669
02:49:18,490 --> 02:49:25,050
All right? That was supposedly the what people call the Grays, the rays from Zeta Reticuli.

670
02:49:28,470 --> 02:49:50,510
So OK, let's just keep moving here. Good morning. You're on the air coast to coast AM with our bell, John Lewin, Bob Lazar. Yes, this questions for Bob Lazar. I was reading an article in the Los Angeles Times for November and it was regarding a experiment going on approximately 2 miles inside

671
02:49:51,320 --> 02:49:56,040
Mount Andriki and Southern Russia with Vladimir Garvin.

672
02:49:57,630 --> 02:50:25,470
Regarding the neutrino. Are you familiar with that at all? I'm familiar with a neutrino, but not the experiment they're conducting. Oh really? Well, I suggest that you get that article is in the Los Angeles Times and the very enlightening. I was curious if you were able to make any connection between the the neutrino and the Gillian Gilliam experiment. But done being done by it's called Sage SH EE.

673
02:50:26,470 --> 02:50:36,630
What, what what specifically were the Russians doing? Well, it's a combination Soviet and US experiment

674
02:50:38,360 --> 02:50:43,040
with their. I was hoping you could answer the question, but

675
02:50:45,120 --> 02:50:48,960
they're particularly looking for subatomic matter.

676
02:50:50,390 --> 02:51:01,430
All right, Clarks and things of that sort. All right. Thank you. Is, is that the purpose of one of the purposes of the accelerator in Texas? They're building? Well, that's certainly one of them.

677
02:51:03,910 --> 02:51:34,390
It's kind of a useful tool. There are a lot of things you can do with an accelerator on the subatomic level, but certainly one of them is the building blocks would actually compromises protons and neutrons. And looking at the different flavors as they say of quarks and other subatomic particles that only exist in areas of extreme energy and only come into an exist only were in existence at the very creation of the universe. So in exploring the subatomic world, you're kind of looking back

678
02:51:34,670 --> 02:51:49,710
time, Bob, again, I'm not a I'm not a physicist, but I heard also from this astronomer, perhaps a question directed at him earlier, that we are from time to time able to detect neutrinos from the sun here on Earth. Is that correct?

679
02:51:51,590 --> 02:51:57,310
Well, first of all, our neutrino detectors aren't really worth very much.

680
02:51:59,880 --> 02:52:00,440
But

681
02:52:01,750 --> 02:52:11,430
yeah, neutrinos. Neutrinos are not only produced by the sun, but we can detect them. Neutrinos will go clear through the Earth. In fact, it's theorized that

682
02:52:13,110 --> 02:52:19,670
a light year of lead, I mean it's like somewhere on the order of 6 trillion miles of lead would not stop a neutrino.

683
02:52:22,080 --> 02:52:41,240
That's why I was interested to see what what experiments the Russians were were doing with neutrino since it'd be very hard to interact them with any matter. Well the further comment was there was worry that they have not been detecting as many neutrinos as they once did and this was some sort of source of worry. Neutrinos really don't do anything.

684
02:52:43,830 --> 02:52:55,590
It's it's. I would find it difficult for it to be a source of worry. Would you think there would be something approximating miniature black holes with such a thing exist?

685
02:52:57,510 --> 02:53:21,710
Oh, I would think that's certainly possible. You know, remnants of a collapsed star, like any black hole is theorized to come from. Certainly there can be a a small one. In fact, one of the explanations for what happened in the in where was that in Russia and Tunguska, I think it's pronounced that was one of the theories that a small black hole collided there,

686
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:26,000
a piece of antimatter landed there. They had all all kinds of

687
02:53:27,870 --> 02:53:39,910
explanations for that. Would the damage done there fit what would probably occur were we to ever collide with a black hole? Collide with us would be more like it. It would have to be very small.

688
02:53:41,590 --> 02:53:42,390
Uh, and

689
02:53:44,230 --> 02:53:51,030
who knows what happens when you collide with a black hole. That's that's the only problem. As far as the antimatter explanation,

690
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:59,480
I, I, I think they've almost ruled that out because there would be some residual

691
02:54:00,830 --> 02:54:09,350
byproducts of that reaction that could probably still be detected today. But there again, it's an after the fact. It was a long time ago, I think it was

692
02:54:10,950 --> 02:54:16,110
in 1918, maybe 1930. Boy, that date just slips my mind. But

693
02:54:18,360 --> 02:54:22,640
Line 3 in Las Vegas, you're on the air coast to coast with the group here.

694
02:54:24,070 --> 02:54:26,110
Good morning. Las Vegas Line 3.

695
02:54:27,470 --> 02:54:41,830
I guess not, gentlemen. Las Vegas line one. You're on the air. Yeah. My question is directed to Mr. Lear and it has to do with the way the areas communicate. I had an experience many years ago where

696
02:54:43,560 --> 02:54:52,440
I received a message. It was a wordless knowing. You had Roy Masters as a guest, and I've heard him speak of that.

697
02:54:54,520 --> 02:55:01,160
It's the only way I can describe it. It's a wordless knowing. A wordless knowing might be described as intuition.

698
02:55:01,750 --> 02:55:20,590
Well I always thought it was a message from either the creator or the savior or a guardian Angel. However, just listening to this program tonight, I think possibly it could be an alien because they communicate telepathically.

699
02:55:20,710 --> 02:55:26,030
And that's I think what this was and it by the way, it was a kind and helpful

700
02:55:28,440 --> 02:55:47,400
knowledge. I was following a wrong lifestyle. And after I got that wordless knowing that message, I changed that lifestyle. All right, thank you very much for the call, John. John, is that their manner of communication sub plan? Understanding that it is mental telepathy is is difficult as that is to believe that that's the way it works.

701
02:55:48,590 --> 02:55:57,150
Mental telepathy. Any basis for scientific belief in mental telepathy or it's a possibility of it, Bob,

702
02:55:58,830 --> 02:56:16,710
I imagine it's possible, but that's, that's about all that I'm going to say about that. Well, okay, but you're a physicist. And if mental telepathy were possible, what would be the form of energy that it might utilize or could even possibly utilize?

703
02:56:17,310 --> 02:56:21,390
I don't know. That's why I, you know, really didn't comment much further on it.

704
02:56:23,240 --> 02:56:37,560
There really is no appearance there, really. I was. There have been people that have claimed. It's strange because I just had this discussion today with somebody about remote viewing, people with telekinesis, things of that sort.

705
02:56:39,480 --> 02:56:52,160
As far as telekinesis, there have been several people that have claimed they can do it. No one has ever been proven to be telekinetic there. Then there is no truth to the rumor that there were Russian experiments in that area and videotape of it.

706
02:56:52,910 --> 02:56:56,630
The video tapes were proven to fall. Oh, oh, oh, they were. Yeah. I

707
02:56:59,030 --> 02:57:06,270
as far as other, I personally believe that remote viewing exists because I saw an experiment done

708
02:57:07,590 --> 02:57:33,790
taken that as being whatever form of energy would be used for communication. That person was put in a Faraday shield was essentially as a grounded screen and was shielded in several other ways. And there was also electromagnetic noise induced to kind of scramble any possible signal. The bottom line was, however, they could see in another area. Nothing affected it. So it's obviously

709
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:41,360
there, again, something we know very little about and you really can't comment on it until our knowledge base increases about that.

710
02:57:41,750 --> 02:57:45,590
All right, wild card line three, you're on the air coast to coast and with the group.

711
02:57:46,750 --> 02:58:10,350
Good morning. I didn't expect you to get me so quick. Well, there you are. Where are you? I'm in Phoenix and I'm got you on KKOB out of Albuquerque. Albuquerque. Yes, Sir. I want to direct one question to John and Bob. By the way, thanks for staying on. John. Last August you were talking about the military building some tunnels

712
02:58:11,480 --> 02:58:17,480
kind of crisscrossing the country from white sand to NORAD and so on and so forth.

713
02:58:19,230 --> 02:58:49,550
I believe the technology and everything is there. But you know, just give me in your wild imagination, what do you think they did with the debris? How did they hide that? All right, thank you. It's a good question. If you dig tunnels, you end up with a lot of dirt. They that's been asked several times. And when they when they dog said the supposed base adult. See, I heard that they took the dirt and and and put it 80 miles away so that there wouldn't be any debris that would let you see if there was something.

714
02:58:50,430 --> 02:59:14,390
Apparently according to this article that I said on the last program in Omni Magazine 1983, and I forget what this of the month was. Apparently that tunnel digger either compacts it or or destroys it or turns it into some other form where they don't have to dump it somewhere else. All right. When I was a youngster,

715
02:59:15,240 --> 02:59:21,960
the man who trained me in amateur radio got me introduced to to amateur radio was himself a physicist.

716
02:59:22,710 --> 02:59:23,390
He was

717
02:59:25,160 --> 02:59:30,520
Polish of Polish extraction and he was working on obtaining a nuclear

718
02:59:32,360 --> 02:59:52,440
reaction or a reaction of some sort from materials other than uranium. Would this, would this be possible, Bob, a nuclear reaction? Well, a a reaction, in other words, trying to release the energy from materials other than uranium in the in the same fashion that uranium releases

719
02:59:52,630 --> 02:59:57,310
energy. Well, then that's, that's a nuclear reaction. Yes, yes.

720
03:00:00,380 --> 03:00:10,540
It's, well, you can take any element for that matter and involve it in a nuclear reaction. And you look at the, look at the sun,

721
03:00:11,990 --> 03:00:40,110
uh, it's a fusion reaction. It's not a fission reaction, but that's taking hydrogen and justice, squeezing it together essentially and, uh, producing tremendous amounts of nuclear power and, and helium as its exhaust. Now this is the technology that we're striving to manufacture this, This would be a perfect energy source. We can get hydrogen out of the water in the ocean and essentially the only exhaust would be helium, wouldn't be radioactive debris or anything along those lines.

722
03:00:40,590 --> 03:01:07,110
There are some stars that use carbon, nitrogen cycle that involve carbon and nitrogen and helium and another form of nuclear reaction. But these things take tremendous amounts of power to initiate. Even the easiest one to start, I believe you have to hold a 10,000,000°C for several seconds just to initiate it. And we've been trying to do that for about 70 years now. And, you know, we just can't,

723
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:12,000
we can't produce that much temperature and, and contain it in a small area,

724
03:01:12,350 --> 03:01:33,710
sustain it. I think they've produced some pretty high temperatures instantaneously, haven't they? Yeah, they, they have. They have had some recent English requirements in there and different technologies. Lasers are trying laser fusion in the tokamak reactors, but no one's been able to hold it long enough. Because if you do hold it long enough, the reaction becomes self-sustaining as soon as long as it's fed hydrogen.

725
03:01:35,480 --> 03:01:41,440
Have you not experimented with a hydrogen powered automobile? In fact, you had one, didn't you Bob?

726
03:01:42,230 --> 03:02:08,550
I built one several years ago and I had a 1978 Trans Am and I converted that to run on hydrogen. In fact, entered an alternate fuel contest and I won. I drove from Woodland Hills, CA to Kitt Peak, Arizona, the observatory there on a single tank. Well then why aren't you up hobnobbing it with the Big Three and being wined and dined? And in other words, why didn't they grab it and and produce it?

727
03:02:09,480 --> 03:02:12,120
Well, again, this is no phenomenal technology.

728
03:02:13,190 --> 03:02:42,150
The conversion is very similar to that of converting cartaran on propane. Hydrogen's a flammable gas. A car will run on any flammable gas. The only problems were some corrections in the timing. Actually, there's a few other because hydrogen burns much faster and would tend to detonate. The the tricky part is storing it. Most hydrogen cars have stored it in a liquid form, which is very dangerous, explosive, and it's cryogenic. It's very cold and it boils off

729
03:02:42,790 --> 03:03:07,870
and it can only be stored at a certain densities. Other people have stored it in gas form, which is a less density, requires more stops to refill. Again, it's dangerous. There's another way to do it and that's to chemically store it in a material called dehydride. And this is a substance that acts like a sponge. A sponge soaks up water, hydrides, a chemical that soaks up hydrogen, and once it's locked into it chemically

730
03:03:08,680 --> 03:03:13,840
it's virtually non flammable. You can get a car carrying a tank full of gas would be much more dangerous.

731
03:03:14,390 --> 03:03:21,960
And the way you get it out is you use either the exhaust or radiator water to warm the hydride and evolve the hydrogen. The only problem

732
03:03:22,190 --> 03:03:44,270
here was that these hydrides or the amount of hydride I used in one in my car, it's reusable, you can refill it with hydrogen and so on. Ran about $15,000 and we didn't know what the lifetime of it was, but there were several corporations during research in there. One of them is a big one called Billings Energy Corporation. I don't remember where they are, but

733
03:03:45,590 --> 03:04:10,430
and they have several vehicles running on it. It's just not economically practical right now, but it's certainly a viable alternative. All right, thanks for the story. I've always wondered about that. Line 2, you're on the air Coast to coast. AM with the group. Hello. Our California. Yes. Good morning, Mr. Lear and Doctor Lazar. How are you doing? Hi. I'm Doctor, by the way. Degrees to me mean doctors, unless you have a temperature. I see.

734
03:04:12,120 --> 03:04:15,720
My first question is for Mr. Lear. I'd like the

735
03:04:17,630 --> 03:04:27,270
where I could get information on that hands off law regarding intact UFOs, fragments, and the occupants. Well, I'm glad you asked that because I just pulled that off

736
03:04:29,600 --> 03:04:30,800
thinking that somebody would call

737
03:04:32,510 --> 03:04:33,710
and it is

738
03:04:36,010 --> 03:04:39,330
14 CFR 12/11

739
03:04:40,390 --> 03:04:44,750
of the Code of Federal Regulations, OK. And what it says is

740
03:04:46,880 --> 03:05:11,720
anyone who sees it and approaches a UFO and is able to touch the object may be liable for $5000 fine and or a year in prison if he or she does not submit to detention. Wait a minute. Have you been fined, Bob? No, I've never heard of this before. What are you reading this from, John? From the Code of Federal Regulations, 14 CFR 1211. It's has to do with touching UFOs

741
03:05:12,350 --> 03:05:42,350
and it says what if you have touched a UFO? Yeah. Anybody who sees or approaches a UFO or touches the object may be liable for a $5000 fine and or a year in prison if he or she does not submit to detention. See, Bob, just why submit it to detention? I was going to say just one more insult. I have a couple of questions for Mr. Lazar. Very quickly. Do you think the recent advantage advances in ceramic metal technology will be used in a Buffard ramjet project?

742
03:05:43,140 --> 03:05:44,700
And the last question is,

743
03:05:46,520 --> 03:05:54,640
are bio metals being developed for use in data storage and retrieval as well as espionage? All right, Thank you. Can you handle that, Bob?

744
03:05:56,350 --> 03:06:02,270
Well, as far as what biomedicals are being used for, I, I don't know. I know very little about them.

745
03:06:04,280 --> 03:06:05,400
What was the first question?

746
03:06:06,750 --> 03:06:12,790
Now, I couldn't possibly regurgitate that kid answered that one first because I

747
03:06:14,190 --> 03:06:44,790
knew the answer to that one. No, you had that one. Well, darn. All right, think about it. Listen, folks, Bob, I'm only going to request that I have you for about 7 more minutes if I can have you that long, and then we'll do the last hour with John. Bob, it's been such an honor. Both of you stand by for a second and we'll do that and we'll do this and we'll we'll get it all handled and be right back. You're listening to the CBC and VRN radio networks together in the night time from Las Vegas. I'm Art Bell,

753
03:08:18,960 --> 03:08:29,840
Good morning again from Las Vegas. Unusually, Bob Lazar and John Lear with us together this morning and let's quickly go back to them because we don't have a whole lot of time here.

754
03:08:30,670 --> 03:08:53,910
Gentlemen, you're back on the air again and I'll give you a final moment. I just want to give one more call in here and I'll give you a final moment to get a plug in for where to get that tape in a moment. Good morning. Are you on the air? Coast to coast AM with what I now call the group. Where are you calling from, please? Thank you, Lord. I'm calling from Santa Fe, NM, New Mexico. OK. This is indeed an honor and a pleasure.

755
03:08:55,240 --> 03:09:07,000
I had the opportunity to catch John and Bob in August when they were on the air and listening to that show gave me shivers for a couple reasons.

756
03:09:07,830 --> 03:09:32,670
In 1989 I had an experience in the mountains of New Mexico, which after viewing from objects in the sky, I started to write down some things on the following days. One of the things that I drew was something like a sphere with almost an ethereal ring around it or a field around it and wrote down

757
03:09:35,400 --> 03:09:38,920
the IT had an aspect of folding and bending space.

758
03:09:39,790 --> 03:09:59,550
I, I wrote down seven other aspects. And then when I listened to your show in August and Bob Lazaro, I ordered your tape immediately after that and it gave it, it put shivers and chills through me. All right. This is the first time Bobby ever been on air with me. That I'm aware of anyway,

759
03:10:00,590 --> 03:10:27,430
but indeed, John was here and talked about Bob's. Well, there was another gentleman with John. Yes, yes, that's right with the imaging program. That's right with NASA, I believe. Yeah. And Eddie will, one of the updates that I wanted to then you put in. OK. Well, thank you for the program. Enjoy it. Thank you very much for the call and good morning. And line one, you're on the air coast to coast to Amador phone John Lear. Good morning.

760
03:10:28,320 --> 03:10:28,760
Good morning,

761
03:10:29,750 --> 03:10:34,510
Mr. Lehrer. I have two or three questions for you.

762
03:10:36,560 --> 03:10:45,360
You were talking about time travel a little while ago and you mentioned it also on the last program, that it actually had conducted the successful experiments.

763
03:10:48,600 --> 03:11:00,280
What was the question that somebody has conducted? Yeah, on your last, last program, you indicated that that it may not have been anybody from this Earth, but well, that's fine. My question though, is

764
03:11:01,310 --> 03:11:32,150
are you familiar with the Rainbow Project, the Montal Project, and the the Phoenix Project just vaguely from, is that the stuff that the Al Bailey talks about exactly? You know, the Philadelphia Experiment and what I wanted to. I mean, I've been reading these books talking about that, and the things are just so fantastic in there. That he traveled 40 years into the future, from 1943 to 1983 and then back again to 43.

765
03:11:32,750 --> 03:11:49,590
And this is all a result of attempts to make a battleship for a destroyer. I guess it was invisible, the USS Olympics and as a result of not only becoming visible, but it went through time and space.

766
03:11:51,590 --> 03:12:17,750
So I was wondering what your opinion on that is or if you have one at all on his credibility. All right, thank you. I'm not inclined to believe it. I try to stick to kind of nuts and bolts and and things that I can see and stuff that Bob's told me and and I just don't. I know Al and I haven't talked to him very much about about that, but I just somehow I just I just don't believe it.

767
03:12:18,640 --> 03:12:24,800
First time caller line, you're on the air coast to coast AM with John Lehrenart Bell. Good morning. Hi, I have two questions.

768
03:12:25,230 --> 03:12:36,670
All right. The first was you should mention something about when you die, your soul goes to heaven and aliens. No, I'm sorry. When you die, the aliens take your soul to another planet.

769
03:12:38,840 --> 03:12:40,240
Now see, how did you hear all that,

770
03:12:42,480 --> 03:13:07,760
John, tell them what you know about souls and containers and such. You know, it's, it's just theory that it's supposedly the aliens referred to us in containers. Now, if if by saying containers they mean that we contain the soul, then obviously they're doing experiments with the soul. And when you die, supposedly they collect the soul and they put it in another container. And I don't know that to be true.

771
03:13:08,190 --> 03:13:16,870
Well, see, I mean, I did hear you say that. I just, is there anything I could read about that I did? Is there anybody who's written anything good about this? John

772
03:13:20,080 --> 03:13:40,040
Whitley, who in his books, how do you spell his last name? Treber Listen, Sir, he'll spell it for you. STREIBER Whitley St. And he's written two or three books. OK. The other question was, is there any? I know this is all speculation and stuff, so, but is there any

773
03:13:40,630 --> 03:13:47,310
speculation about there being like an alien culture that's nonviolent with no state structure?

774
03:13:48,870 --> 03:13:55,350
I don't. I don't know anything about that. You never heard anybody talk about that, nor have I Is that it, Sir? Yeah. Thanks. All right. Thank you,

775
03:13:57,350 --> 03:14:00,150
John. You just have to wonder where some of this stuff comes from.

776
03:14:01,880 --> 03:14:15,240
All right, let me see here. Wild card line three. You're on the air. Coast to Coast AM with our phone. John Lear. Hi. Good morning, Arton. John, A very entertaining show. Thank you. Where are you calling from? This is Barry in Phoenix. Phoenix. OK, Barry,

777
03:14:17,360 --> 03:14:24,280
Mr. Lear here, you agree that there's much CIA disinformation about UFOs?

778
03:14:25,390 --> 03:14:50,390
Yeah, there is a lot, a lot of disinformation. Pardon me. There is a lot of disinformation. Well, you mentioned the the Brent Waters event in England, Bent Waters. Yeah. Is there any possibility that that could have been staged? And the reason I asked that is because the troops that were called out to witness that were all told not to take any arms,

779
03:14:52,550 --> 03:14:56,510
yes. They were all told to leave their arms in their barracks, yes,

780
03:14:59,440 --> 03:15:24,320
out to the spot that they were going to witness. They all were unarmed. And the only reason I can think of this is that that it was a staged event. Well, it was a staged event, but the question is who staged it? Probably the CIA. Well, it's possible. Oh, isn't that something? All right. Thank you. So some of all this could be in a sense, more intentional disinformation, John.

781
03:15:24,870 --> 03:15:49,630
Well, when I say they staged it, I mean they staged it with real well, I'm not going to get into that. I, I get, let me get into it a little bit. In other words, you can take something that is basic truth, like the the appearance of UFOs and disks and all the rest of it, and you can you can stretch it to an absurdity and and when you do, you discredit all that goes before it. Really

782
03:15:50,480 --> 03:15:51,440
potentially that's an issue.

783
03:15:54,160 --> 03:15:54,480
All right,

784
03:15:54,950 --> 03:16:14,030
let's keep moving here. Good morning. You're on the air coast to coast AM with Art Bell and John Lear. Where are you calling from, please? I'm Scottsdale again, Art, I have one more point. And no, no, Sir, I'm sorry we don't allow a callback on these shows, but I I appreciate the attempt line to your turn. Good morning. Good morning. I have a comment and a couple of questions.

785
03:16:14,870 --> 03:16:23,590
I think interstellar or extraterrestrial travel, I think time is against. Is that right or not? Against us or anybody else?

786
03:16:24,790 --> 03:16:25,790
The time it takes.

787
03:16:26,910 --> 03:16:37,030
Oh well yes, with conventional means of transportation sub light that would of course be correct. I'm talking about light here, and even faster.

788
03:16:38,990 --> 03:16:40,430
And another thing is

789
03:16:42,280 --> 03:16:47,000
what would a tablespoon of matter from a black hole

790
03:16:48,880 --> 03:16:49,200
way and

791
03:16:51,440 --> 03:17:00,280
more, more than that you can imagine, and certainly more than it would be for you to be able to get the spoon then to your mouth, right? And can any

792
03:17:02,920 --> 03:17:09,560
true explanation on the term gravity? Can anybody really explain it? That actually is a very good question.

793
03:17:10,270 --> 03:17:23,670
What the hell is gravity, John? Well, I not being a physicist, I don't know, but according to Bob, there's two forms of gravity, gravity A and gravity B and gravity A is the

794
03:17:25,440 --> 03:17:45,840
the small atomic force and gravity B is the large force like the earth and the the planets in orbit around the of the sun. All right, very good. Let's see first time caller line. You're on the air coast to coast AM with our phone. John Lear. Hello.

795
03:17:46,870 --> 03:18:17,470
Hello. Hi. Where are you calling us from? I'm calling from Fresno, Fresno, CA. All right, John Lear's listening. What is your question? Well, my husband years ago met Mr. Lewis father in Reno. And my question is could he review again about the helicopters and the men upcoming in black uniforms? Kind of a review that again, I heard that before and I didn't get all of it. I understand, John. I've seen

796
03:18:17,590 --> 03:18:44,310
black helicopters, no markings. We've talked about that before. What are they? I don't know. There's plenty of them around. Apparently there's a lot of UFO incidents in which black helicopters appear with men dressed in black jumpsuits. Whether they're ours or theirs, I don't know. There's also appearances of helicopters that are that are absolutely noiseless, like they were just images, like they weren't really helicopters at all.

797
03:18:45,110 --> 03:19:09,510
Well, exactly. The ones that I've heard are not quite silent, but not far from it. And you don't hear them very long. The moment they they're gone a little bit they're they are silent. I just heard of some of our helicopters that are very, very quiet. All right, hold, hold on right there, John. We're going to do another quick break. If you're listening to the CBC and PRN radio networks in the night time.

798
03:19:10,480 --> 03:19:13,200


799
03:19:20,550 --> 03:19:21,910
KDWN Las Vegas.

800
03:19:40,320 --> 03:19:42,280
From the home of S4.

801
03:19:44,200 --> 03:19:48,240
An area. Area 99. Area 51

802
03:19:49,190 --> 03:20:16,030
areas that don't even have numbers. They're so secret. Las Vegas, the desert in the Great American Southwest. Welcome back to COAST to Coast AM. I'm Mark Bell and I'm going to give a quick version of the number of something I've not even had time to do this morning. If you're in the metropolitan area of Las Vegas, you can reach us at 38382558255 if you're out of state, toll free.

803
03:20:16,880 --> 03:20:20,320
It's 1800 three 3/8

804
03:20:20,630 --> 03:20:44,230
8255, the wild card direct our lines area code 702-385-7214 and if and only if you're a first time caller, should you call area code 702-385-7213. John, you there? All right, we'll hop Scotch and this morning will be done before you know it.

805
03:20:45,680 --> 03:20:49,640
Wild card line three, you're on the air. Coast to coast AM with Art Bell and John Lee are high.

806
03:20:50,940 --> 03:21:04,020
Hi, how you doing? We're we're both fine. Where are you calling from? Buttonwillow, California. Wow, I don't know where that is, but go ahead. It's outside of Bakersfield. OK, I have a question for for John. I just tuned in and I was curious.

807
03:21:06,160 --> 03:21:13,760
Does he believe that there's any interbreeding going on between humans and aliens? And to what ends do they expect to achieve?

808
03:21:15,070 --> 03:21:39,430
Yes, supposedly there has been, you know, breeding. Apparently it's an ugly thought, John. Pardon. I say it's an ugly thought. Now, apparently they're trying to interbreed, for apparently their race is dying out. At least this is the story some of the objectives come back with, and they're trying to interbreed with us to make a stronger form of themselves.

809
03:21:40,680 --> 03:21:41,560
Very interesting.

810
03:21:42,870 --> 03:21:45,830
OK. Thank you very much. Right. One of the speech. Thank you.

811
03:21:47,760 --> 03:21:51,560
That's a very disturbing thought, John, for most human beings,

812
03:21:52,870 --> 03:21:56,270
you know, unless there's cute little green chicks or something.

813
03:21:57,870 --> 03:22:02,830
All right, Good morning. On the first time caller line, you're on the air. Coast to coast AM with our phone. John Lear

814
03:22:04,190 --> 03:22:17,950
is this is this Art Bell? It is yes. I'm flabbergasted. It's so nice to talk to you both. This is Billy and I'm calling from Ontario. And

815
03:22:19,680 --> 03:22:42,520
John, I talked with you recently at the Congress in Las Vegas, at the Hacienda, you know, in the magic shop, right? I happened to have heard Al Balick and I picked up the Montauk project and saw his presentation. And I am a follower of Tesla

816
03:22:43,590 --> 03:22:44,190
and

817
03:22:45,960 --> 03:22:55,160
I happen to really buy everything that Al Baileyk has said. And if you will talk to Bob Brown, who put the Congress on,

818
03:22:57,360 --> 03:23:15,840
And also, do you, have you seen Al Balik's presentation at all? No, I have not. Well, I think you might. He held the audience in the palm of his hand, and everyone was absolutely not breathing. They were so entranced with everything that he had to say.

819
03:23:16,350 --> 03:23:43,790
Well, ma'am, what kind of things did he say? I mean, the rest of his house, his knowledge of electronics is absolutely impeccable. I would love to hear Bob Luzar and Al Bailey get together. And if you like art, I will send you Albic's number and maybe sometime you could do a show with him. Why not? Oh, why not indeed? Call my network and and I will I will send further information but

820
03:23:44,680 --> 03:23:48,880
Montauk project and also the knowledge I have. I went with a friend

821
03:23:49,550 --> 03:24:14,550
who had was on the panel and she had some fascinating things to say also. So I really think there's a whole lot further to go in this whole area. And I really appreciate your having everybody on. And I'm sorry I didn't. My tape recorder wasn't working. I couldn't get the show tonight. All right. Well, if you listen carefully, I will shortly tell you how to get a copy of it, but we have got to go.

822
03:24:15,480 --> 03:24:23,400
Wonderful. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, John. Hold on. We'll be right back. And I will be back with the information about how to get a copy of this show in just a moment.

823
03:24:23,910 --> 03:24:51,390

824
03:24:52,240 --> 03:24:56,320
Does your business search for the investor who follows world events as a prelude to investment?

826
03:25:30,230 --> 03:25:34,950
from Jackie Gonz Plaza downtown. This is KDWN Las Vegas.

827
03:25:36,800 --> 03:26:00,200
Good morning and welcome back to the show, the one you waited for and have certainly received this morning. If you want a copy

828
03:26:00,950 --> 03:26:31,310

831
03:27:03,750 --> 03:27:14,270
Oh well. Good morning again, John. How you doing? Fine. Let us now continue. Wild card line three. You're on the air Coast to coast AM with John Leonard Bell. Good morning.

832
03:27:16,080 --> 03:27:24,000
Yes, I'm sorry. Good morning, aunt. Good morning, Mr. Aaliyah. May I communicate with you, Mr. Leah? I'll write to you through us now.

833
03:27:25,750 --> 03:27:52,870
Sure. Absolutely. All right. I will ask you, Russell, and take up time. Something happened with a recurrence that I was not into your your apology totally out of context. I'm convincing enough that it left Boss an irreparable memory with me. I was there at any time a colony of aliens on Earth who later found the atmosphere to be hostile and mimical to them.

834
03:27:53,760 --> 03:27:55,760
But would they ever come back?

835
03:27:56,190 --> 03:28:09,550
And so there were remaining descendants of that colony. They could no longer stay the atmosphere. As I said, being hostile. It's also becoming becoming catastrophe. It's also a man becoming hostile to some of us that are here now.

836
03:28:11,360 --> 03:28:26,320
No, this did not have the appearance. I I can't go into the details. Time won't permit enough at all. Hostile, but that there are descendants and there is a coming catastrophe and warning us and alerting us etcetera.

837
03:28:27,270 --> 03:28:43,830
All right, well, thank you John. What about it? Well, what's the question? Well, the question is about the possibility of a coming catastrophe. It's really a it's a it's a follow up on the question I gave you earlier. I'm a terrible prophet is the answer again.

838
03:28:44,670 --> 03:29:08,230
OK, what about the question on atmosphere? Is, is it possible that our atmosphere is utterly hostile, even poisonous to ones who don't normally breathe this mix of oxygen and such? Probably, probably hostile to some life forms. That's where that's why you see them wearing helmets and and masks and and different things and old carvings and

839
03:29:09,600 --> 03:29:31,200
other kinds of documents like that. All right, So they're no different than we were. We were to go to another planet. They'd be helmeted. And I believe some of the the graphics on rocks here have shown creatures wearing apparent helmets. Is that not true? Right. All right, wild card line three. You're on the air Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell and John Lear. Hi. Yeah. Good morning, Art.

840
03:29:32,870 --> 03:29:42,230
I take a certain amount of this is with a grain of salt and I'm I'm sure that Mister Lehrer does to what? No, No he does not, Sir.

841
03:29:44,080 --> 03:29:47,120
That he absolutely believes what he's saying and

842
03:29:49,480 --> 03:30:07,160
neither of you read the book The body Electric by Doctor Robert Baker. All right, thank you, John. No, I have not What what does it say? He's gone. I, I, so I don't know, I but I do want to follow him. The first part of what he said because he was ascribing to you an apparent and apparently

843
03:30:08,830 --> 03:30:34,590
a feeling that isn't really there. I mean, you don't take all this with a grain of salt at all, do you? Or a couple of people have said that. I remember on a show we did once before, a guy called and said you're doing this tongue in cheek, Aren't you, Art And and well, I'm certainly not. No, I, I believe it. I believe it 100%. So all right, so there he was in Idaho. I know that. All right, good morning. You're on the air Coast to coast and with our phone, John Lear. Where are you calling from, please?

844
03:30:35,440 --> 03:30:37,280
Alaska. Alaska. Yes, Sir.

845
03:30:37,550 --> 03:30:46,430
Yes, I've got a couple questions. I'll make this brief. I'd like your opinion of the MJ 12 report, Majestic 12 report

846
03:30:48,120 --> 03:30:52,200
given to Eisenhower. I'm sure you're familiar with that and also

847
03:30:54,200 --> 03:31:04,040
Bill Cooper, what you think of the information he released. And the third thing would be what your personal opinion of who Jesus Christ is.

848
03:31:06,560 --> 03:31:07,680
Thank you.

849
03:31:08,110 --> 03:31:39,430
The MJ 12 report, the information I believe is essentially true. Whether that document that Bill Moore passed around is is legitimate or not, I don't know, but I think the information is true. As far as Bill Cooper, he got more into the conspiracy part of this than I did. So, you know, I don't have any comment there. I did talk to him the other day and he seems to believe that the Masonic Lodge is behind all this stuff and aliens don't exist and there are no

850
03:31:39,870 --> 03:32:03,630
saucers. But, well, that's a new direction. And finally, John, and most importantly, please now reveal to us who Jesus Christ really is. That's a toughie. I'm going to let you you do that. Awesome, thanks. You know what I do at moments like that? I push the next button. Line three, you're on the air with our phone. John Lear, good morning. Good morning. You know you're talking about gravity.

851
03:32:04,760 --> 03:32:09,040
I believe that what we currently believe is gravity

852
03:32:09,510 --> 03:32:39,910
is probably something totally different than what we believe it is. I'll give you an example. What I currently believe gravity to be is this. Gravity is a pulling force due to the size of mass. In other words, on Earth we weigh a certain amount of weight. If we were on the moon, we weigh 1/6 the weight because the mass of the moon is 1/6 that of the Earth. And I will even add to this. Do you think that people falling off very

853
03:32:40,230 --> 03:32:48,150
buildings consider things like this on the way down? Probably, especially the nature of gravity. So they hit the third floor.

854
03:32:50,760 --> 03:33:14,160
Anyway, what I wanted to say here is not with the with like a black hole. The mass in a black hole is so condensed the gentleman was talking about a tablespoon of mass from a black hole would probably have the same mass density as the earth. So think of it this way. If two magnetic poles of the same pole, like 2 N poles repel each other.

855
03:33:14,710 --> 03:33:45,150
So if you could get the density out of a black hole that had the same mass of the earth, those two masses would probably repel each other. You know, like magnets do. Well, that sounds like a question for Bob or statement. Yeah, too bad. Now I want to take this one step further. You talking about Tesla? And what Tesla was dealing with, According to him, were tachyon particles. Now, in tachyon theory, they say that gravity is not a pulling force,

856
03:33:45,550 --> 03:34:05,670
it's an accelerating force, and that the Earth, she acts as a shield for the tachyon particles. So with that theory in mind, and I guess with that theory, it's a workable theory, in the Tacamp particle theory, the idea of gravity changes. All right, we've got to hold it there, so thank you.

857
03:34:07,480 --> 03:34:20,840
The whole notion of gravity and what it is is very interesting, isn't it, John? And it's hard to know whether it's a pulling force or a Bob describes it as a wave. But I'll have to wait till he's on next time if you really want to know the bottom line.

858
03:34:21,150 --> 03:34:42,190
All right. Very good. Wild card. Line three, you're on the air, coast to coast and without phone. John Lear. Hello. You've cut me off before I could ask my question. OK, go ahead then. Sir. Yes, Sir. Don't you really feel that the great threat to civilization is the great imbalance of of strategic nuclear forces right now rather than anything alien? All right, Thank you, John. Your answer

859
03:34:44,240 --> 03:34:59,880
don't be who has who's who's the enemy? Well, I guess whatever was the Soviet Union, Russia and the other individual republics still do have actual physical possession. Nigh on 30,000 nuclear weapons.

860
03:35:00,670 --> 03:35:29,510
So, you know, the bottom line is I don't believe that there is a threat now. And quite honestly, I don't believe there ever was a threat. And the reason why as a friend of mine had spent the on a summer cruise in Russia with with Olaf collusion, who was the former chief of intelligence for the KGB and and was fired in 1985. And this guy told him to ask me anything. He said, you know, they can't do anything more to me and they haven't done anything, you know,

861
03:35:30,400 --> 03:35:31,280
ask me your questions.

862
03:35:31,590 --> 03:36:00,670
So my friend asked, well, how about the Rosenbergs? Were they guilty? And he said, yeah, they were died in the world communist. He said, how about Oswald? He said Oswald was a nut. We didn't have anything to do with him. And then he asked about the the Cold War and this ex head of the KGB said it was the Russians being equal to us in technology was was manufactured by the by the US intelligence agent. It never was a fact. They were never that close to us.

863
03:36:01,670 --> 03:36:25,870
Cold War was more or less a myth fabricated by somebody. Well, it's going to be interesting to see what the next reason to keep to keep a building and keep developing will be. John. All right, let's see. Line one. You're on the air coast to coast and with Art Bell and John Lee. Thank you. I was wondering, I know that he, Mr. Leah has talked about a number of different kinds of species

864
03:36:26,920 --> 03:36:34,280
of aliens or in 1984 I think a book came out called Dark Eyes. On the cover of the book

865
03:36:35,030 --> 03:37:00,910
was a spacecraft that looked like upside down aircraft carrier. In other words, Bob Pite was the flat top that jets will land us. In 1978, I had seen a similar aircraft and most people talk about sausage and things like that. And that's why this book just sort of pops up, popped up to me, because I had seen this thing flying. I was about

866
03:37:01,960 --> 03:37:05,920
eight stories off the ground in the Midwest, somewhere in the city,

867
03:37:07,150 --> 03:37:15,430
and it was just above a cloud cover. It seemed like, you know, you couldn't really see if I shook the whole neighborhood and some people

868
03:37:16,310 --> 03:37:43,870
and stated that they had seen it till my class stops and other things like that. I was wondering do you have any idea of what that was or no? There's all kinds of different craft and some of them are just immense beyond belief. I think a British Airways crew saw one in the early 50s over Kuwait. It was 6 miles in diameter. There's one that was seen in

869
03:37:44,880 --> 03:37:47,320
in China that was 10 kilometers in diameter.

870
03:37:47,630 --> 03:38:06,430
There was one that was seen by a booty or a Japan Airlines cargo 707 in 1987 over Alaska. And this thing was three times as big as an aircraft carrier. And you know, my only question is what if there was only a two man crew on that one?

871
03:38:08,240 --> 03:38:17,440
You know, thank you, caller. John, I'm going to add to that a little bit. I One of the things that you once said to me did cause me to kind of raise my eyebrows really high.

872
03:38:17,750 --> 03:38:25,030
And it was something about, and I cannot recall, it may have been a 10 kilometer spacecraft of some kind that you referred to.

873
03:38:25,430 --> 03:38:36,590
And that sent my eyebrows up. And in ham radio, we have a method of communication called packet, which is nothing more than a kind of a fancy way to send

874
03:38:38,280 --> 03:38:59,400
information. And it appears on a screen. It can be stored in a computer and recalled and sent over networks. And doggone if there wasn't a pretty serious packet report the other day of a sighting of something that was supposedly miles long. And and the moment I heard that, I remembered your comment on that gigantic spaceship of era from very, very large ones that have been seen

875
03:39:01,510 --> 03:39:06,230
at Line 2. You're on the air coast to coast. And with our phone, John Lear, Good morning. Good morning.

876
03:39:08,000 --> 03:39:27,440
Mr. Lear, have you read Communion? Yes. What do you think of it? It's it was scary when I read it was when I first started this research and I heard about it. I was on my way to the airport. It was a flight from Las Vegas to Cleveland. And I kind of it was it was a night flight. I kind of

877
03:39:29,480 --> 03:39:40,280
read it on the way and when I got to Cleveland, it was an overnighter there. I couldn't turn the light on. I mean, it was, it was so real to me. Now, a lot of other people have read Communion and then they think it's, you know,

878
03:39:40,670 --> 03:40:03,190
so, so. But for me it struck a true note. It felt really, really real to me. OK, I there's another book out called Being by Michael Redfin. Have you had an opportunity to read that one? No, I haven't. He's a British father, isn't he? I believe so. It has more to do with a spiritual side of these.

879
03:40:04,030 --> 03:40:04,950
Beings,

880
03:40:05,750 --> 03:40:08,150
and it has a lot

881
03:40:10,070 --> 03:40:38,430
well, maybe they're angels, maybe they're not and so forth. Another question, what is the purpose of this 115? All right, Element 115 John Formant 115 is the fuel that they use in an annihilation reaction, which creates the the positive voltage and the and somehow they get the gravity B wave which is channeled and amplified to provide the travel that they that they use.

882
03:40:39,440 --> 03:40:45,360
All right, good morning. On the first time caller line, you're on the air coast to coast AM with Arthur and John Lear. Good morning.

883
03:40:45,990 --> 03:41:11,750
Good morning. I have a couple of questions for John. Sure. Where are you calling us from, John? I'm sorry, Tucson, that's quite all right. Go ahead. I'd like to have his opinion on the reports of instant healing that appear occasionally in the records of association with UF OS. And also I'd like to know what he feels about these abduction cases where usually they report being

884
03:41:12,640 --> 03:41:15,200
carried through solid walls or windows.

885
03:41:16,340 --> 03:41:44,460
Really. I've I've read both of those. Both of them are very interesting. Apparently the instant healing has occurred. I don't know how it has occurred. The one about being carried through the walls really puzzles me. There's also being carried through a car. They feel that their body is going through the car, or at least their soul because they can look back in the car and see their their body, but they feel like they are wherever they're being transported.

886
03:41:45,440 --> 03:41:58,680
Yes. It's always puzzled me, but it's like Bob Lazar was talking about mental telepathy. Until we have more information, we're not going to know how they did it. It seems to be a frequency beyond anything we know about. Yes. All right. Thank you very much, Carl.

887
03:41:59,110 --> 03:42:29,270
Good morning. That opens a line in Las Vegas 38382558255 or I should say there is one open. John, do you think we might get Mr. Schreiber in as a guest one of these days with you? I don't think so. We we had kind of a falling out here about 4-5 years ago and it was over something, you know, just like most fallings out, it was over a minor thing. But yeah, I haven't talked to him in quite some time

888
03:42:29,790 --> 03:42:32,190
and I don't know whether he's done any interviews

889
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:45,600
after the the disaster that the movie comedian was. I don't think he's been out much. All right, very good. Wild card line three, you're on the air, Coast to coast to Amador, bound John Layer High.

890
03:42:47,640 --> 03:43:07,280
I had a question about I hadn't read a book. Oh God. It was about five years ago, and I can't remember the name of it, but it was about the moon. And a lot of the people in the Soviet Union believe the moon is actually a alien aircraft of some type that could hollow.

891
03:43:10,320 --> 03:43:34,320
Yes. And that's what Bob is was referring to is the some of these theories are so far out, you know, he just wondered who cooked them up and where they came from. But yes, I have heard that. I've heard that it's a spaceship and there is aliens unified and and all that and was brought here and, and all that stuff. Yeah, they said there's a a whole that goes into the

892
03:43:35,320 --> 03:43:48,680
they can't even, you know they can't, they can see the hole, but they can't see all the way inside it. Well, let me join this little parade of strangeness. I've, I've also heard that there are large Earth moving machines on the moon

893
03:43:50,280 --> 03:44:16,400
and that sort of thing. John, any anything about that? Oh, no. The guy, the guest we had on the other day, Rob Miley, it was his father that saw the picture of the Earth booming machine. It was 300 or 100 yards in in length. And it was shown to him by an asset photographer very confidentially. But in fact, yes, that that picture was taken by. Am I still online? Yeah, you're online. OK,

894
03:44:17,560 --> 03:44:21,800
I had another question. I heard another thing that the Soviets might have is

895
03:44:23,470 --> 03:44:26,350
things that can produce earthquakes.

896
03:44:27,990 --> 03:44:31,470
Really they owe us a lot of money for California.

897
03:44:33,760 --> 03:44:58,080
Hadn't heard about that John. Oh, I have not heard about that. All right, well, thank you caller. Good morning line three you're on the air coast to coast AM with our bound John Leer high. Yes, good morning. That's a very interesting show. Bob Lazar was I like to hear the science behind all these things. The, and I kind of agree with Lazarus thing about 99.9

898
03:44:59,110 --> 03:45:02,870
something percent of this being just off the wall.

899
03:45:04,800 --> 03:45:17,880
But there was one thing that that just hit me a little while ago talking about the some Soviet KGB guy who says the Soviets were never close to us in technology

900
03:45:19,150 --> 03:45:43,230
that was all of collusion. Well, I beg to differ with that because at one point they were way ahead of us. I mean, you know, they had Sputnik up and their throw weights as far as what they can put on a, on a missile where yes, Sir, but that's brute force category. Technologically, we are and always have been and will be probably for a long time, way ahead of them, Is that not

901
03:45:44,040 --> 03:45:47,960
When they were putting up Sputnik? We were probably already on the moon.

902
03:45:49,510 --> 03:46:07,270
Well, deal dear with that caller that that goes way beyond where we started taking over was where we we had the computers and because of our societal freedom, the spread of computers and the usage by the people.

903
03:46:09,120 --> 03:46:21,520
So say something very profound. OK, I, I think that as far as the aliens go, until they come and have direct communication with us, it's all conjecture

904
03:46:21,830 --> 03:46:52,040
and what's the point? I mean, I think that we could use our mass knowledge and working together for more important things than. All right. All right. Thank you. Well, all right, that's actually almost a good question. John. Caller was talking about technology that the public knows about, right? What the government has, our technology base runs approximately 30 years ahead of what the of the public knows. So there you go, Sir John will be right back with yet a bit more. Stay right there.

905
03:46:52,590 --> 03:46:55,430
This is the CBC and VRN Radio Network.

906
03:46:57,240 --> 03:47:17,400


907
03:47:20,230 --> 03:47:46,590
Good morning, everybody. Once again from Las Las Vegas, the high desert. Hasn't this been special? We've had John Lear with us. He's here for a couple more moments. Dom Lazar was here for a couple of hours and it has been an enchanting night, to say the least. I'm Art Bell. It's been a pleasure to be with you this week. In the fleeting moments of the show, I want to do, as I always do, say thank you for a wonderful week of talk radio.

908
03:47:47,320 --> 03:47:55,560
It really has been a pleasure, folks. And now back to John Lear. John, are you there? All right? We don't have a whole lot of time left.

909
03:47:56,030 --> 03:48:21,790
And so to be sure that I get it in John, that tape that explains everything, why not take one more crack at giving out the address? It's try dot Corporation, that's TRIDOT Corporation 1324, that's 1324 Southeastern and that's in Las Vegas, NV 89104

910
03:48:22,680 --> 03:48:26,160
and it's 2995 + 3 dollars shipping and handling.

911
03:48:27,350 --> 03:48:56,270
Let's take a couple of lingering questions. People have been waiting so long. You're on the air Coast to Coast AM with our phone. John Lear, where are you calling from, please? Good morning, Art. This is Bonnie from Clear Lake. Clear Lake. Yes, I got my Ross for a watch. It's beautiful. I have a question for John though. Does everybody have a soul? The Bible says there's only so many and and if we're all keep being reborn again, how come there's billions of people and only so many souls?

912
03:48:56,550 --> 03:49:04,830
Well, that's a good question. Actually. I think we talked about that once before and I said that I knew a people, a few people that I didn't suspect that. So

913
03:49:06,840 --> 03:49:14,680
which is my just like my going to line three, line 1 is where I'm going right now. You're on the air with John Leonard Bell. Good morning.

914
03:49:16,070 --> 03:49:43,630
Hello. Is this Yes, Sir. Oh, yes. John, do you know anything about the effects of of magnetism on these craft or whether they are influenced or they utilize our magnetic fields or anything? So that would be a question for Bob. Yeah. OK. Well, thanks. Thank you. Have a good morning. Out of state, you're on the air coast, Coast AM with John Leonard Bell. Hello.

915
03:49:44,440 --> 03:49:46,920
Hello, Lord. Hello. Where are you calling from, Sir?

916
03:49:48,700 --> 03:49:53,420
Kodiak, Alaska. All right, John Lear is here. Do you have a quick question?

917
03:49:54,230 --> 03:50:01,830
Yes, Sir. Has he ever heard of the raw material? What was that again? The raw material, RA.

918
03:50:03,830 --> 03:50:07,470
Oh, yes, yeah, I'm sure he has. Yes, he has Sir

919
03:50:09,150 --> 03:50:33,750
to see if he could call me and I'll listen up here. All right, I don't have. All right, thank you from well, it's just a book, you know, just like all the other stuff that has spiritual stuff and you know, like like a lot of other books, like your ranch and and stuff like that. Oh, that is an interesting topic. And I don't think I don't think I say that we've ever really touched on that. All right,

920
03:50:34,640 --> 03:50:37,960
quick. Quickly, because we're about out of time Line 2 for John Lear.

921
03:50:38,390 --> 03:50:42,870
John. Yeah. Is it true you the UFO crash at Roswell?

922
03:50:43,790 --> 03:50:55,870
Absolutely, positively true. True. And Hangar 18 are the four bodies at Hangar 18 and has anybody been in that hangar? I think the Hangar 18 May just be,

923
03:50:57,640 --> 03:51:25,080
it may have been hanger 18, but certainly there were four bodies which hangar they went into. I don't know the most credible of all the incidents, though, John Roswell. The most credible of all the UFO incidents, Roswell certainly that we have most of the evidence of the evidence that Stan Friedman and Don Berliner collected on it. They interviewed over 105 witnesses, many of them still living, that either touched or had something to do with that recovery.

924
03:51:25,670 --> 03:51:29,190
All right, caller, gotta go. OK. Thank you, John. We're out of time. So look,

925
